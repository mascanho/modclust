how-to-start-creating-your-csrd-report-the-importance-of-double-materiality-assessment/,"paragraph","Creating a comprehensive and impactful sustainability report under the  Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)  is no small task. For companies aiming to deliver their first report in 2025, the groundwork must begin  at least two years prior to the report’s due date . The bulk of the effort is not in the financial year the report covers but in the years leading up to and following that year, especially during the  preparation phase and when compiling the report itself ."

This critical step helps you determine which sustainability topics are relevant to your business and must be reported."
how-to-start-creating-your-csrd-report-the-importance-of-double-materiality-assessment/,"paragraph","The process of CSRD reporting is a significant undertaking, and there’s much to prepare for. The  European Sustainability Reporting Standard (ESRS)  provides the detailed framework for what companies need to report. At a glance, this document spans nearly  300 pages  of guidelines, and it includes over  80 disclosure requirements  across a wide range of sustainability topics. To give you a sense of scale, this equates to more than  1,100 individual data points  that need to be considered."
how-to-start-creating-your-csrd-report-the-importance-of-double-materiality-assessment/,"paragraph","However, don’t let the sheer volume of data overwhelm you. The good news is that not every company will need to report on every single one of these data points. The key to narrowing down what to report on lies in your  double materiality assessmen t."

how-to-start-creating-your-csrd-report-the-importance-of-double-materiality-assessment/,"paragraph","To illustrate how the double materiality assessment works, imagine you are an orange farmer in Spain. You use pesticides, which can negatively impact  biodiversity and ecosystems  (ESRS E4). This is an example of an  inside-out  impact—the effect your operations have on the environment."
how-to-start-creating-your-csrd-report-the-importance-of-double-materiality-assessment/,"paragraph","However, you also face challenges due to  climate change —the region where you farm is becoming hotter, and prolonged droughts are affecting your yields. This is an  outside-in  impact, as climate change is influencing your business operations (ESRS E1)."
how-to-start-creating-your-csrd-report-the-importance-of-double-materiality-assessment/,"paragraph","Both of these impacts, the one you create and the one you face, are material and need to be assessed as part of your double materiality analysis."
how-to-start-creating-your-csrd-report-the-importance-of-double-materiality-assessment/,"paragraph","The most significant advantage of conducting a double materiality assessment is that it allows you to focus on what matters most. If a particular topic is deemed not material, you won’t need to include it in your report. This reduces the number of datapoints you must track and report, potentially excluding a large portion of the  1,100 data points  identified in the ESRS."

optimised-service-levels/,"paragraph","Service levels  are critical in  supply chain planning , impacting how your business balances customer satisfaction with  operational efficiency ."
optimised-service-levels/,"paragraph","The service level reflects your company’s ability to deliver products or services to customers – on time and by the agreed conditions."
optimised-service-levels/,"paragraph","A high service level is essential for maintaining customer satisfaction, strengthening the company’s reputation and ensuring competitiveness. The service level indicates the probability of having goods available and thus being able to fulfil orders. In other words, if your service level is 95%, you will be able to satisfy 95 out of 100 orders."
optimised-service-levels/,"paragraph","Service levels are an integral part of your company’s supply chain strategy. It affects your competitiveness, customer satisfaction, reputation and your operational efficiency. You can unlock significant benefits that empower growth by prioritising and investing in service levels."

optimised-service-levels/,"paragraph","Strategies and costs to secure flawless service"
optimised-service-levels/,"paragraph","Your company’s strategy must guide the specific level of service you offer your customers. But, maintaining a high level of service is not without cost. One approach might be to ensure you never miss a delivery by keeping extra inventory on hand. Alternatively, a cost-focused strategy might accept that there will be some instances where you can’t fulfil every order."
optimised-service-levels/,"paragraph","The relationship between service level and supply chain planning is complex due to several factors. Customer demand often varies between different products, which requires a nuanced approach. Products with stable demand patterns may have lower requirements for safety stocks compared to items that are seasonal or that have sporadic demand."
optimised-service-levels/,"paragraph","Finding the right balance requires a thorough analysis based on robust  forecasting  and logical segmentation."
optimised-service-levels/,"paragraph","In addition, the specific industry condition also plays a role. In some industries, the ability to deliver is crucial. For example, in  retail  and healthcare, high levels of service are necessary to avoid lost sales and customer loyalty issues. In other  industries , customers may also be more price-sensitive. Take discount retail environments, for instance; cost efficiency can be prioritised higher than service levels."
optimised-service-levels/,"paragraph","Customer satisfaction can be enhanced by raising service levels, ensuring reliable delivery, and building customer loyalty. This, in turn, strengthens the company’s reputation and helps maintain its competitive edge. But service levels can be a double-edged sword."

Additionally, maintaining high service levels comes with costs, requiring a balance between ensuring product availability and managing operational expenses."
optimised-service-levels/,"paragraph","The importance of service levels varies by industry. For instance, retail and healthcare industries require high service levels to avoid lost sales and maintain customer loyalty. In contrast, industries with price-sensitive customers, like discount retail, may prioritize cost efficiency over higher service levels."
optimised-service-levels/,"paragraph","One of the key factors directly influencing business competitiveness is the implementation of efficient and cost-optimised processes. Within this framework, inventory management—particularly stock control—plays a critical role in achieving these goals, as it directly impacts how customers perceive your business."

expanding-supply-chain-planning/,"paragraph","Improving supply chain planning is crucial for boosting efficiency, cutting costs, and responding faster to market demands. However, the key to successful improvement is involving the right people throughout the process."
expanding-supply-chain-planning/,"paragraph","The supply chain team plays a central role. They are on the frontline of operations, handling the day-to-day procurement, logistics, and inventory management tasks. These team members are acutely aware of where the current processes fall short and where bottlenecks occur. Their firsthand knowledge and operational experience make them the go-to experts for identifying areas that need improvement. Involving them early ensures that any changes are practical and grounded in real-world challenges."
expanding-supply-chain-planning/,"paragraph","The sales and operations planning (S&OP) team also must be engaged. Supply chain planning doesn’t happen in isolation; it must align with the broader goals of the business, especially in terms of meeting customer demand. The S&OP team provides demand forecasts and key insights into market trends, allowing the supply chain to respond proactively. Their involvement ensures that supply and demand stay balanced, preventing stockouts or overstock situations and optimising inventory levels."
expanding-supply-chain-planning/,"paragraph","The procurement and supplier management teams also play a pivotal role. They ensure the supply chain has access to the right materials and services at the right time and price. By involving suppliers in the improvement process, you build stronger relationships with suppliers, ensuring they align with your operational goals. These teams are instrumental in reducing lead times, improving quality, and managing supplier risks, all of which contribute to a more agile and resilient supply chain."
expanding-supply-chain-planning/,"paragraph","No supply chain improvement can happen without IT and data analytics support. Technology underpins every aspect of modern supply chain planning, from real-time tracking of shipments to predictive analytics for demand forecasting. Involving your IT and analytics teams ensures you have the right digital tools to optimise processes. These teams can help implement new systems, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) platforms or artificial intelligence tools, to predict trends and streamline operations. Data analytics, in particular, provides crucial insights that allow for more accurate forecasting and data-driven decision-making."
expanding-supply-chain-planning/,"paragraph","Involving the finance team when improving supply chain processes is also essential. Supply chain improvements often have a significant financial impact, whether in terms of cost savings or new investments in technology and infrastructure. The finance team can assess the cost-effectiveness of proposed changes and ensure that they align with the organisation’s overall financial strategy. Their input ensures that supply chain improvements are operationally sound and financially viable, helping the company achieve its broader profitability goals."
expanding-supply-chain-planning/,"paragraph","Customer service and sales teams bring another valuable perspective to the table. These teams interact directly with customers and understand their pain points, expectations, and needs. By involving them in the supply chain improvement process, you ensure that changes are aligned with what your customers want. This is particularly important for reducing  delivery times , meeting  service level  agreements, and ultimately enhancing  customer satisfaction.  Feedback from these teams helps to refine  demand forecasting  and  product availability  strategies, making the supply chain more responsive to customer demands."
expanding-supply-chain-planning/,"paragraph","It’s also important to involve external partners, such as suppliers and third-party logistics providers. Supply chains don’t operate in a vacuum, and improvements often require collaboration across the entire network of suppliers and partners. By engaging external stakeholders, you can identify opportunities for joint improvements, better communication, and process integration. This broader collaboration can lead to improved efficiency and reduced costs across the entire supply chain, not just within the organisation itself."
expanding-supply-chain-planning/,"paragraph","Executive leadership must be involved. No significant change can happen without the support and commitment of senior leaders. Executives provide the strategic vision and resources needed to implement supply chain improvements. Their involvement also ensures that changes are aligned with the overall business strategy and that there is organisational buy-in for the necessary changes. Leadership plays a crucial role in fostering a culture of continuous improvement and ensuring that cross-functional collaboration happens effectively."
expanding-supply-chain-planning/,"paragraph","Improving supply chain planning is not a task for a single department but a collective effort involving various stakeholders. Each group brings unique insights and expertise that contribute to a more efficient, resilient, and customer-focused supply chain. By involving the right people from across the organisation and beyond, companies can build a supply chain that is agile, cost-effective, and capable of meeting the demands of the market."

navigating-the-complexities-of-aftermarket-inventory-management/,"paragraph","Imagine your car breaks down, and as if that weren’t inconvenient enough, you’re told the exact part needed to fix it is out of stock and won’t arrive for another week. Practical issues start to pile up—like not being able to drive your kids to school or bring home the weekly shop. Unexpected expenses for public transport, delivery fees, and disrupted plans quickly add up. Frustrated, you can’t help but wonder: How can they not have such a vital part in stock?"
navigating-the-complexities-of-aftermarket-inventory-management/,"paragraph","This example clearly illustrates the pressure customers place on aftermarket companies to ensure essential spare parts are always available for urgent repairs. However, what customers often don’t see are the complexities these businesses must navigate. Aftermarket providers face high expectations for availability, knowing that delays can result in lost sales or broken contracts. On top of this, they must also manage long lead times, a broad assortment, and items that are difficult to forecast."
navigating-the-complexities-of-aftermarket-inventory-management/,"paragraph","This article explores why effectively managing these critical spare parts is so challenging —and, more importantly, discusses  strategies aftermarket companies can adopt  to overcome these challenges and improve their inventory management practices. These insights come from  Roberto David , a Solution Architect at Slimstock  with extensive expertise in the aftermarket industry."

navigating-the-complexities-of-aftermarket-inventory-management/,"paragraph","Within a broad assortment, different techniques are needed to forecast the diverse items effectively. Fast-movers, like tyres, with frequent and steady sales, are easier to forecast due to their continuous demand patterns. Slow-movers, like specific chips, on the other hand, have infrequent sales, making accurate statistical forecasting challenging due to a lack of data points."

navigating-the-complexities-of-aftermarket-inventory-management/,"paragraph","For  aftermarket companies , the majority of their assortment consists of slow-moving items, which complicates the forecasting process."
navigating-the-complexities-of-aftermarket-inventory-management/,"paragraph","To avoid excessively high safety-stock levels, improving forecast accuracy is crucial. Using the right forecasting algorithm—rather than a simple moving average—can help reduce uncertainty. Less uncertainty will allow for lower safety stock while still meeting customer demand. A more reliable forecast not only enhances availability but also enables planners to make confident, data-driven decisions."
navigating-the-complexities-of-aftermarket-inventory-management/,"paragraph","Another challenge lies in the changing nature of SKU numbers, as parts evolve or get replaced by newer models. A challenge with new or reintroduced SKUs is the lack of historical data for reliable forecasting.  Like-for-like modelling  addresses this by transferring  demand history  from predecessor SKUs, enabling data-driven forecasts for new items."
navigating-the-complexities-of-aftermarket-inventory-management/,"paragraph","Additionally, when forecasting demand for parts related to a new vehicle model, another critical factor comes into play: the value of the vehicle itself. Parts for high-value, luxury vehicles are more likely to require  OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer)  replacements, while owners of lower-budget vehicles often choose cheaper aftermarket parts. By factoring in this repair ratio between OEM and aftermarket parts, demand forecasts for new model parts can be more accurate from the start."
navigating-the-complexities-of-aftermarket-inventory-management/,"paragraph","Demand planning is already challenging due to forecasting complexities and high availability requirements. However, supply planning presents its own set of difficulties, as most spare parts are sourced from Asia, resulting in long lead times for much of the world."
navigating-the-complexities-of-aftermarket-inventory-management/,"paragraph","To manage both the uncertainty in demand and supply while maintaining the right availability, a service-level -driven inventory strategy is essential. Where your goal is not to hold a certain day of cover, but to reach your end goal: ensuring timely and cost-efficient service for your customers."
navigating-the-complexities-of-aftermarket-inventory-management/,"paragraph","Setting service levels can be challenging, but using segmentation methods such as  ABC classification  and considering product-specific factors can help optimise them. For instance, in the automotive aftermarket, critical parts marked as VOR (vehicle off road) mean a car remains inoperable until the part is available. Stockouts of these parts negatively impact both customers, who experience downtime, and suppliers, who may need to provide alternative vehicles. For such items, assigning higher target service levels can help prevent these costly delays."
navigating-the-complexities-of-aftermarket-inventory-management/,"paragraph","An effective inventory strategy must address the broad aftermarket assortment, tailoring approaches for each category—like tyres, filters, and oils—with specific service levels and forecast methods to match demand patterns."
navigating-the-complexities-of-aftermarket-inventory-management/,"paragraph","Tyres, for example, have steady demand, making them suitable for automated management. In contrast, high-cost items like turbochargers are unpredictable and costly to stock, requiring a balanced approach that combines automation with focused monitoring to avoid overstock and prevent stockouts."
navigating-the-complexities-of-aftermarket-inventory-management/,"paragraph","A significant part of this broad assortment is hard to forecast, but there is still immense pressure on availability. This combination creates a high risk of overstock, which often results in obsolete stock, as these items are not sold regularly. So, how can you reduce the instances where stock becomes obsolete?"
navigating-the-complexities-of-aftermarket-inventory-management/,"paragraph","Keeping all essential spare parts in stock without overfilling your warehouse is no easy task in the aftermarket industry. With hard-to-forecast items, long lead times, and a broad assortment to manage, it’s easy to fall into the trap of stockouts and frustrated customers—while also trying to keep the business profitable."
navigating-the-complexities-of-aftermarket-inventory-management/,"paragraph","Fortunately, these challenges can be overcome. By improving demand planning, using smarter forecasting techniques, and adopting a proactive supply chain strategy, aftermarket companies can ensure that the right parts are available when customers need them. Automating assortment reviews and setting up alerts for demand changes can further help prevent costly overstock or obsolete inventory. With the right tools and strategies in place, aftermarket companies can meet customer needs while optimising their inventory management, ultimately improving both profitability and customer satisfaction."

scor-model/,"paragraph","The SCOR model offers multiple benefits for companies that implement it, among which we can highlight the following:"
scor-model/,"paragraph","A primary goal of SCOR is to contribute to the continuous improvement of the supply chain. To this end, it sets out clear, precise metrics that allow companies to measure supply chain performance across five key variables:"
scor-model/,"paragraph","Assesses the ability to meet expectations through KPIs such as OTIF ( On Time In Full: delivering orders on time and in full )."
scor-model/,"paragraph","Measures the speed with which a supply chain can fulfil customer orders, with the key metric here being Order Fulfilment Cycle Time."
scor-model/,"paragraph","Assesses the ability to adapt to market changes and respond to disruptions, such as a sudden supplier closure, a natural disaster, or a geopolitical issue affecting the supply chain. A key KPI here is Value-At-Risk."
scor-model/,"paragraph","Monitors costs associated with supply chain operations, such as labour and transport costs."
scor-model/,"paragraph","Optimises the use of assets within the supply chain, with metrics such as  CCC or Cash Conversion Cycle , and  Days Inventory Outstanding ."
scor-model/,"paragraph","In addition to describing processes and establishing KPIs, the SCOR model also highlights certain practices, classified into three main categories: emerging practices, best practices, and standard practices."
scor-model/,"paragraph","These practices are designed to improve supply chain efficiency, with their implementation depending on each organisation’s specific needs and sector."
scor-model/,"paragraph","These practices introduce new technologies or innovative approaches that can transform supply chain management. While implementing them can involve high risk, they also offer substantial benefits, redefining how processes are organised within the industry."
scor-model/,"paragraph","An example of an emerging practice is using artificial intelligence for demand forecasting, which could revolutionise how companies plan their inventories and production."
scor-model/,"paragraph","Considered structured, repeatable, and proven practices, these have shown a positive impact on supply chain performance. They are widely adopted across various industries and organisations, offering consistent results with moderate risk."
scor-model/,"paragraph","For example, the use of Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP) is a recommended best practice in SCOR to align demand with production."
scor-model/,"paragraph","Standard practices are those historically used by most companies, though they may not offer a significant competitive advantage. While they do not yield major benefits, they remain effective."
scor-model/,"paragraph","For example, using traditional ERP systems for inventory management and resource planning continues to be a common and effective standard practice."
scor-model/,"paragraph","Each SCOR practice is linked to one or more processes, metrics, and skills, allowing companies to select and apply the most suitable practices according to their specific context. The model’s flexibility enables organisations to adapt these practices to their unique needs."
scor-model/,"paragraph","Another notable aspect of the SCOR model is its approach to talent management. This area provides a framework for managing the skills and competencies employees need to efficiently carry out supply chain processes."
scor-model/,"paragraph","The SCOR model identifies key skills for each supply chain process, designed to enhance staff capability in each critical area:"
scor-model/,"paragraph","In addition to skills, SCOR emphasises the importance of:"

management-by-exception/,"paragraph","In modern supply chain management, the exponential growth of product assortments and the increasing number of stores and warehouses present a constant challenge. As catalogues expand with new entries, the complexities of efficiently managing each item also increase. This is where management by exception comes into play, offering a structured methodology to prioritise tasks, mitigate risks, and maximise profitability."
management-by-exception/,"paragraph","Management by exception is an operational approach that identifies and prioritises elements deviating from what we would consider normal conditions. In practical terms, it means focusing efforts on specific products or situations that require immediate or specialised attention, while leaving those operating smoothly within expected parameters to run their course."
management-by-exception/,"paragraph","In inventory management, this approach moves away from the idea of reviewing all items equally. Attempting to manage thousands of products uniformly is not only inefficient but can also lead to a poor allocation of resources, internal friction, and often, financial losses."
management-by-exception/,"paragraph","For many organisations, adding new products to the catalogue is relatively straightforward. However, removing obsolete or underperforming items tends to be a slower and more complex process. This creates an operational environment where assortments grow continuously, making daily management increasingly complicated."

management-by-exception/,"paragraph","ABC  analysis is widely used in inventory management. When combined with additional factors such as sales, margin, or turnover, it provides a much more accurate segmentation."
management-by-exception/,"paragraph","For example, a product that is an “A” in sales and “C” in turnover will require a different strategy from an item that ranks “A” in both criteria."
management-by-exception/,"paragraph","Once products have been classified, the next step is to create specific selections that streamline daily operational tasks. These selections group items with common characteristics, improving both efficiency and prioritisation."
management-by-exception/,"paragraph","In management by exception, selections are divided into five main categories:"
management-by-exception/,"paragraph","Selections are also differentiated according to the type of task:"
management-by-exception/,"paragraph","A product experiencing exceptionally high demand may require adjustments to forecasts. Management by exception helps determine whether these changes are temporary or structural, allowing for corrective decisions to prevent future errors."

management-by-exception/,"paragraph","Once products are classified, the next step is to create selections that group items with common characteristics or similar needs. These selections allow for more efficient exception management. For example:"
management-by-exception/,"paragraph","Advanced technological tools, such as  Slim4 , help in creating, visualising, and tracking these selections."
management-by-exception/,"paragraph","The key to a successful exception-based management model is having a system in place that allows for real-time monitoring of exceptions and their assignment to the appropriate team. This includes:"
management-by-exception/,"paragraph","A robust system not only improves efficiency but also reduces errors and ensures that exceptions are handled promptly."
management-by-exception/,"paragraph","Adopting an exception-based management model involves a shift in how work is carried out. It is crucial that teams understand the methodology, classification criteria, and the use of technological tools. Training should focus on:"

management-by-exception/,"paragraph","An example of managing by exception would be identifying that a critical product is facing a stockout in two weeks. Using a technological solution, an alert is triggered, allowing the team to place early orders with the supplier, find an alternative source for the product, or redistribute inventory from another warehouse. This prevents supply chain disruptions and financial losses, focusing on resolving a specific issue without dedicating time to items that are functioning as expected."
management-by-exception/,"paragraph","Technology in managing by exception helps automate anomaly detection, generate real-time alerts, and prioritise critical tasks. Advanced tools, such as inventory management systems, make it easier to analyse data, create custom selections, and monitor key performance indicators.

tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","Port strikes, rail strikes, Canada Post strikes, it seems like we just can’t get a break from crisis. So let’s add another one on top: tariffs."
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","Where strikes have a relatively predictable impact, the looming threat of tariffs brings unpredictability: we do not know what, we do not know when, and we do not know how these tariffs will affect us."
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","This uncertainty can be crippling, it’s difficult to make decisions based on something so uncertain to happen. However, as supply chain professionals we are no strangers to uncertainty."
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","Although we cannot prevent tariffs from happening, we can certainly model the effects of tariffs on our supply chain costs and make informed decisions on how to move forward. This will still partlybe like a bet, albeit an informed bet and not a blind one. In Dutch, we have a saying: “A forewarned person counts for two” – in my opinion this is also true for businesses."
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","Supply chains will be impacted by tariffs, the question is where. If we map the impacted areas, we can model options to mitigate the impact as much as possible and make the best choice possible."
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","Some effects can end up macro-economic, some effects will manifest at the product mix level, and some effects will affect your cost."
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","Tariffs obviously impact the cost of buying raw materials or finished goods if imported, and this will change the price at which you can sell, and the value of the inventory you have."
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","This can have an impact on the working capital available or your cash flow, it can lead to short-term reductions in your  cash-to-cash cycle  as well if you pay your suppliers before you sell your products at the increased rates."
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","In terms of economic conditions, we’ll likely face something close to a recession, or lower spending by consumers in anticipation, or because of layoffs or other effects. Tariffs will impact the price at which you can sell goods to stay profitable, while the money consumers have available does not necessarily increase."
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","This leads to reduced consumer spending. It’s important to layer in these economic effects in your business planning as they’ll influence your revenue and cost-base."
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","This is an  S&OP activity  that will impact labour requirements, costs, cash flow and revenue and unit forecasts."
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","When consumers have less money available to spend on goods, a typical strategy for them is to buy the same product but at a lower price. Meaning they’ll choose the cheaper option or brand over the more expensive option or brand."
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","Consumers divert their spending to lower quality products or keep spending on critical products versus nice-to-have’s. Hence macro-economic effects cannot simply be applied to your product forecasts. Some products will see unit increases, while others see unit drops more excessive than the overall macro-economic effect."
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","Price sensitivity analysis is required to estimate the impact of price changes. With this information you can adjust forecasts."
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","Mitigation strategies will help you reduce the impact of price changes, they are ways to optimise your costs under the new conditions. As the cost of products changes, so will certain design principles you have applied to your supply chain change."
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","For a tariff, the following mitigation strategies, or alternatives exist which you should consider."
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","One mitigation strategy companies have started to deploy is forward buying of raw materials and finished goods. Instead of following their regular order cycle, they buy and import months and months of inventory."
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","This will of course have other cost implications as you’ll increase the investment of working capital and significantly lengthen your cash-to-cash cycle. As a rule of thumb, if you divide the tariff % by the yearly holding cost (as a percentage of unit price) you’ll have the maximum amount of forward buys you should do."
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","E.g. if the tariff ends up being 25% and your inventory holding costs are 20% – the math tells us that we can buy up to 1.25 years’ worth of product and still end up with the same cost as if we would’ve bought with the tariff."
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","This is straightforward to calculate, but dangerous. Holding costs are merely an estimate and will change if your  warehouse capacity  and cash position are severely constrained."
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","Let alone product obsolescence, which will increase, and more importantly: you won’t have any cash available to invest in newer product lines, putting a large strain on your business in terms of risk. Forward buys therefore will have to be deployed with extreme caution."
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","Technically storage costs, cost of working capital and product obsolescence are all incorporated in the holding cost calculation; however, they only hold true under normal circumstances."
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","If you decide to buy more than a year’s worth of inventory for all your products, they will not end up the same."
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","Other mitigation strategies would be working with  local suppliers , who might end up more expensive, but without the tariffs, could become competitive."
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","Important here as well is to remodel your inventory holding costs as their short lead time will significantly reduce your inventory buffers, thereby reducing your costs."
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","As the cost of a product will change under the tariffs, this means that the optimal quantity to buy of a product changes as well."
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","More orders per year is now the more viable strategy, as keeping inventory becomes significantly more expensive. You can run an Economic Order Quantity analysis using the new and the old price and analyse the differences."
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","This could have other implications on your supply chain teams as you might have to hire more people to deal with the increase in orders that have to be handled."
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","To get to the best possible strategies, you will have to simulate a few scenarios that are viable. Based on the impact scenarios, and the different mitigation strategies, you can design the following simulations where you will estimate total supply chain costs:"
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","Forecast scenarios:"
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","Mitigation scenarios-buying:"
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","Mitigation scenarios-ordering:"
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","This gives a few viable scenarios to test that we can combine in logical ways. You could run an experiment combining, for example, 1af, which is your current world with tariffs applied."
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","For scenario 2bg you’d be testing lower forecasts while buying forward 3 months and decrease your order cycles. For every scenario, you can calculate the total costs, which will be a combination of holding costs, order and transportation costs. This should allow you to pick which mitigation strategies will work best for your business."
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","Tariffs are unpredictable, but as supply chain professionals we should be able to have a pretty clear picture of what their impact will be."
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","For this we need tools to model its expected impact, and design scenarios which are both realistic and beneficial."
tariff-ic-strategies-for-your-business-planning/,"paragraph","Eventually it’s up to leadership to decide which way to move forward. A bet, but an informed one."

stock-control/,"paragraph","One of the key factors directly influencing business competitiveness is the implementation of efficient and cost-optimised processes. Within this framework,  inventory management —particularly stock control—plays a critical role in achieving these goals, as it directly impacts how customers perceive your business."
stock-control/,"paragraph","Consider, for instance, the disappointment of a buyer who has to wait weeks because the product they ordered online is out of stock. Or imagine a customer entering a store determined to make a purchase, only to leave empty-handed and frustrated because the item was unavailable."
stock-control/,"paragraph","These scenarios often arise from poor stock control, which not only tarnishes the customer’s perception of the business but also leads to negative financial implications. For these reasons, stock control stands out as an essential component of business management."
stock-control/,"paragraph","Let’s start with the basics: what exactly is stock control? Also known as inventory control, it is the  process of managing, monitoring, and verifying the stock held by your business . The primary goal of stock control is to ensure that, at all times, the business can meet customer demand by delivering products promptly and living up to expectations."
stock-control/,"paragraph","However, achieving an effective balance between outgoing stock (sales) and incoming stock (supplier orders) is no simple task. Sales are, to a large extent, unpredictable and directly influenced by consumer behaviour. Meanwhile, managing supplier orders—though under your control—requires careful regulation of order frequency and volume to avoid both shortages and overstocking."

stock-control/,"paragraph","Efficient inventory management is crucial to achieving both financial and  operational efficiency  for any business. Effective stock control isn’t just about knowing how many products are in the warehouse but also understanding how inventory levels will evolve in the future and how they impact various aspects of the business."
stock-control/,"paragraph","Here are the key reasons why you should implement strict stock control:"
stock-control/,"paragraph","Efficient stock control requires strategies and processes that minimise errors, optimise resources, and ensure product availability. Below, we outline key aspects of effective inventory management to prevent losses."
stock-control/,"paragraph","Inventory losses represent the discrepancy between the theoretical stock recorded and the actual stock available. These discrepancies may be caused by theft, administrative errors, damage, expiration, or logistical issues. Understanding the root causes is essential for implementing corrective measures."
stock-control/,"paragraph","Inventory can be lost at various stages:"
stock-control/,"paragraph","Identifying these critical areas helps prevent recurring losses."
stock-control/,"paragraph","To locate missing inventory, consider the following steps:"
stock-control/,"paragraph","Periodic counts, also known as cycle counts, involve regularly reviewing physical stock to compare it with recorded figures."
stock-control/,"paragraph","Here are the key steps:"
stock-control/,"paragraph","In addition to periodic counts, zero-point counts are a simple yet effective method. This involves counting stock when the system shows zero units in storage. At this point, a quick review highlights any discrepancies with ease."
stock-control/,"paragraph","The accuracy index measures the alignment between recorded and actual inventory, reflecting the efficiency of stock management. A basic formula is:"
stock-control/,"paragraph","Inventory Accuracy  = (Actual Stock / Recorded Stock) × 100"
stock-control/,"paragraph","A high accuracy index indicates effective stock control, whereas low values highlight errors requiring immediate attention."
stock-control/,"paragraph","Inventory control tools have traditionally focused on improving the visibility of products in storage. However, it is increasingly necessary to implement software solutions that enable quick and reliable demand forecasting."
stock-control/,"paragraph","Some of the most commonly used technologies for stock control include:"
stock-control/,"paragraph","A standard ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system centralises and automates inventory management by integrating with other key areas of the business, such as sales, procurement, and logistics."
stock-control/,"paragraph","Contributions to stock control:"
stock-control/,"paragraph","While a very basic method, it remains widely used."
stock-control/,"paragraph","It is worth noting that while these solutions address specific aspects of inventory management, achieving full supply chain planning requires an end-to-end supply chain technology such as Slim4."

stock-control/,"paragraph","Ensuring that everything in your warehouse or store aligns perfectly—meaning your physical stock matches the records in your systems—can be made easier with the help of various technologies:"
stock-control/,"paragraph","A Warehouse Management System (WMS) streamlines stock control by automating and enhancing operational processes within the warehouse."
stock-control/,"paragraph","Contributions to Stock Control:"
stock-control/,"paragraph","Typically, the WMS integrates with the ERP system daily to reconcile any numerical discrepancies between the two systems, ensuring stock alignment by the end of each day."
stock-control/,"paragraph","RFID technology employs electronic tags that emit radio signals to automatically identify and track products within a warehouse. These tags can be scanned in bulk, speeding up inventory audits and minimising manual errors. Key applications include:"
stock-control/,"paragraph","While a more traditional technology, barcodes remain a fundamental tool for most businesses. They are used to identify products and record movements within the system. Compared to RFID, barcodes offer advantages such as being more cost-effective and easier to implement."
stock-control/,"paragraph","Stock control is not just about maintaining a balanced inventory, it is also about ensuring accuracy and traceability to prevent losses. Identifying the causes of discrepancies, adopting technologies like RFID or WMS, and conducting regular stock counts are key practices for optimising management."
stock-control/,"paragraph","Additionally, metrics such as the fidelity index can help measure and improve system efficiency. Taking a proactive and meticulous approach ensures not only product availability but also more profitable operations that align with customer expectations. This ultimately positions inventory as a strategic asset for business success."
stock-control/,"paragraph","In this context, the right tools, such as  Slim4 , are essential to take stock control to the next level. This type of software not only reduces inventories and obsolescence risks, but also improves coordination between processes, anticipates crises and optimises customer service. Implementing technology solutions such as these facilitates early detection of problems, offering the opportunity to resolve them before they have a significant impact."

stock-control/,"paragraph","Efficient stock control ensures resource optimisation, minimises financial losses, and improves product availability, leading to higher customer satisfaction. It also enables more accurate forecasting and strategic decision-making based on reliable data, while reducing operational costs. Additionally, it fosters agile management, which is essential for responding to changes in demand and maintaining profitable operations."
stock-control/,"paragraph","Poor stock control can result in stockouts, leading to dissatisfied customers and lost sales. Conversely, it can also cause overstocking, which increases storage costs and the risk of obsolescence. The lack of accurate data hampers planning capabilities, exposing the business to operational inefficiencies and financial losses."
stock-control/,"paragraph","The main challenges include:"
stock-control/,"paragraph","Stock control should be managed by a logistics or inventory management professional with strong data analysis skills and experience with technological tools like ERP and WMS systems. This person should be meticulous, strategic, and capable of coordinating various areas of the business. In smaller organisations, this responsibility may fall to the manager or a multi-functional team member."

supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","If supply chain shocks are new to you, you’re likely new to supply chain. It’s almost par for the course that blips, booms, rises and falls are the parts of supply chain to set your watch by. If you’ve been in this game a while, the times when everything’s going well are the times where concern creeps in. History repeats itself. And just as governments rise and fall, so too do your supply chain fortunes. In the past, you may have adopted some simple tactics to mitigate market volatility. And they probably worked, to some extent."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Maybe you simply ordered more inventory? Or ordered stock sooner than ever before, to avoid disappointment? These days,  the more robust your thinking, the better your supply chain strategy . And the better strategy you have before the disruption comes, the better prepared you are for the inevitable. Supply chain resilience is the name of the game. And those who manage it well normally win the race. But this is a marathon, not a sprint. So, what steps can you take to enable a brighter future for your business?"
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Supply chain management  is all about managing the flow of goods throughout your operation. And of course, a harmonious flow of stock depends on a steady stream of robust data as well a tight grasp of the financial implications of your supply chain actions."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Supply chain management is an extremely broad topic. Whether you are deciding which supplier to order from or where you should allocate inventory within your network, the day-to-day supply chain decisions you make have an impact every aspect of your business."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","From the sourcing of raw materials right through to delivery of the product at its end destination,  supply chain management  is ultimately the value-add process that allows your business to fulfil your customer’s demand."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Your customers measure you by the effectiveness of your supply chain. It’s that simple."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","If an order is delivered late, arrives broken or was out-of-stock, to begin with, these are all red flags your customers look out for. The kind of red flags that could lead them to your competitors!"
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","On the other hand, if your supply chain processes are up to scratch, you can be confident that your products are delivered quickly and efficiently with minimal disruption."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Moreover, you will be better prepared to operate flexibly around unexpected volatility to exceed customer expectations at an optimised cost."

supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Your supply chain can’t exist in a vacuum."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","There are lots of stakeholders with varying degrees of interest and influence."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","From the customers you serve, to you team that places the order and the suppliers that manufacture your products, each plays an important role in shaping your supply chain actions."

supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","The main purpose of your supply chain is to fulfil the needs of your customers. Therefore, it probably makes sense they are seen as a crucial stakeholder within your supply chain decision-making process."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Your customer’s expectations should drive the breadth & depth of your assortment as well as the minimal level of service you need to maintain. As the trigger point for demand (and therefore the main source of your revenue stream), this is a stakeholder you can’t afford to overlook!"
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","“You are only as strong as the weakest link in your chain.” It’s everyone’s favourite supply chain cliché. And with good reason!”"
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Your suppliers are the stakeholders you count on to maintain a dependable supply of the materials, components and finished goods you need to fulfil customer demand in a timely manner."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","But let’s not forgot about the trusty supply chain partners that help get your inventory from point A to point B."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","We’re talking about your  logistics providers , your packaging suppliers & everyone else involved in the distribution of products throughout your operation."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Strong relationships with your suppliers and logistics partners can make or break your business. So, forget these guys at your peril."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","We have covered external stakeholders, but who is leading the charge internally? Well, The Management team are an obvious starting point."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","As the team that is ultimately responsible for shaping the direction and the trajectory of the whole business, management decisions have a direct impact on all supply chain decisions."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","From hiring the supply chain team to setting the desired level of service, the CEO and wider board of directors are responsible for setting the vision and strategy for the organization. But more importantly, they also set the tone for how this vision is achieved."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Sure, the Management Team outline the business ambitions, but the planning team are there to make sure these dreams and desires become a reality."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Ultimately, the planning team are responsible for anticipating future demand and aligning this seamlessly with supply. By collaborating with other internal teams, suppliers and even the end customer directly, the planning team go to great lengths to ensure the right stock is available in the right place."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","No business is exempt from volatility. Therefore, it’s also up to the planning team to anticipate disruption on the horizon and take proactive steps to mitigate risk before it hits the customer. We will explore the topic of supply chain disruption in more detail later."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Your sales team are the voice of the customer. Their entire world is focused on dealing with customers. This means they have an intimate and personal understanding of your customer’s goals, expectations, and concerns."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","On one hand, the sales team play a crucial role in generating demand in the first place. However, as the main point of contact, the sales team also hold invaluable market insight that can be used to enhance the statistical analysis the planning team typically rely on."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","It’s easy to get carried away. Sure, you could fill your warehouse to the rafters with all the stock you could ever need to satisfy customer demand. However, this approach will not do anything for your bank balance."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Thankfully, this is where the finance team comes in!"
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","The number crunchers in finance are there to ensure the financial resources are allocated efficiently and effectively. This means monitoring the financial data and analysing the risks around investments, budgeting, and forecasting."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Given that inventory is likely to be one of the biggest numbers on your balance sheet, the effectiveness of your supply chain decisions is therefore of primary concern. As guardians of the business’ financial resource, this team will often work with teams across the business to improve the efficiency of the supply chain."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Your IT team are the hidden heroes of your entire operation."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","To make good supply chain decisions, all of the people above need robust data. More importantly, they need this data delivered in a way they can utilise it."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","The IT team are there to keep the systems that underpin your supply chain up and running. But when you consider how much data is flying around your business combined with all the inputs required from customers and suppliers, this is no mean feat!"
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Your supply chain is a machine with lots of moving parts. As such, there are lots of processes & workflows that are required to keep your operation ticking along smoothly."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Here are some of the core processes that underpin your operation:"
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","The days of using abacuses & crystal balls to manage your operation are long gone. To cope with the complexity of modern supply chains, businesses need advanced technology that galvanises the people and processes involved."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","For many businesses, spreadsheets are typically the weapon of choice. And sure, complicated, and clunky formulas are better than nothing."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","But effective supply chain technology should be an enabler for your supply chain success. It should help your people make better decisions. It should help your processes run with precision and speed. It should be the glue that sticks everything together!"
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","So far, we have talked about  supply chain management  from a theoretical perspective."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","On paper, the supply chain formula for success probably sounds easy. Involve the right people, set up some clever processes & support it with robust technology, and your good to go!"
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","If only it were this simple!"
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Sure, if the world was nice and stable, this probably would be the case. However, we are never a few heartbeats away from the next big supply chain disruption."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Take the last few years. we’ve had what most would consider a monumental level of disruption to business."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","There’s been worldwide recessions, pandemics, natural disasters, international conflict, and people in power with nuclear codes, you wouldn’t trust with your phone charger."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","And so, in the next section of this guide to supply chain, we will explore how you can build a disruption-proof supply chain."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","You’ll learn how to build resiliency throughout your supply chain processes."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","You’ll understand what supply chain tactics you can deploy to combat volatility."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","You will discover how to investigate the costs involved, and how to adapt your supply chain to cope with whatever the world throws at you."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","But most importantly, you will find out how to ensure your supply chain is geared up to overcome the challenges today as well as take on the hurdles you may encounter in the future!"
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Airline crews have some of the best crisis training in the world. Their response to ‘worst case scenarios’ needs to be absolutely on the money."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","But rather than think about what should happen with every eventuality before take-off. They know the protocols inside out. They know who makes the decisions and how to communicate them to respond in record time."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","When designing your supply chain, the same thinking can take you a long way."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Don’t spend time thinking about lightning strikes. Or fog. Or rogue missiles."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Focus on preparing everyone involved with the experience and know-how to guide you through."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","But let’s bring this back down to earth."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","How does this relate to the resilience of your supply chain?"
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Michelman & Sheffi (1983)   describe two methods for achieving a resilient supply chain."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","In essence, you can either absorb the risk or you can respond to it."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","An absorb strategy focuses on building a protective buffer into a supply chain. Think of this as the supply chain equivalent of the crumple zones on your cars."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","All that extra metal & structural integrity might feel like overkill. But should an unexpected accident occur, this extra measure could well save your life."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","A respond strategy focuses on the ability to remain flexible."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Sticking with the automotive example, this is a bit like your car’s anti-lock braking system. By constantly adapting to changing conditions, this approach helps you to apply the brakes or gas at just the right moment."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Let’s explore each of these supply chain strategies in more depth."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Achieving supply chain resilience through an absorb strategy is a common and straightforward way of dealing with disruption."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Absorbing a shock is a core competency of supply chains, but it comes at a cost."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Naturally, adding inventory or infrastructure can give you a buffer from demand or supply shocks, and create an advantage over competitors."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","You can also create a long-term advantage with an absorb strategy, by giving protection for markets or customers, leveraging expansion opportunities, and exploiting competitive situations."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Everything in life comes at a cost. And the absorption strategy’s no different."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Common ways to absorb disruptions include building excess production or distribution capacity and even investing in additional supply chain infrastructure."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Without a reliable source of supply, however, these strategies are useless and won’t serve you well."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","This is why an absorb strategy generally involves holding inventory at various stages throughout the supply chain. Buts it’s not always the magical silver bullet that will save you in a tight spot."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Many companies invest in  safety stocks  covering ‘expected’ demand and supply variability."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Yet, these safety stock inventories are not typically catered to the scale of disruption witnessed when disasters occur."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Therefore, you may need to introduce processes to determine the optimal level of protection for both expected and unexpected disruption."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Responsiveness is the ability to answer supply and demand shocks through rapid execution. Otherwise called flexibility. Or the art of being quick on your feet."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Respond strategies, unlike absorb strategies, are not necessarily a core competency of supply chains."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","That’s because many of its concepts are built on complicated design."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Examples of respond strategies include:"
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Standardisation of processes can help to quickly switch direction when a"
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","disaster happens."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Allows your business to decrease the time-to-market when changes in demand"
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","occur."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Leaves WIP inventory in a state it can still be modified to fit changing"
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","demands."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Information sharing with customers and vendors, upstream and downstream,"
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","not only benefits time-to-market but also allows for quicker response to"
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","disruptions."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Working collaboratively is a prerequisite for most of the respond strategies above. And like the Absorb strategy, there’s a cost… isn’t there always?!"
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","For a start, it may be more difficult to set up respond strategies in the first place. And on top of that, these strategies may be less proven than filling your warehouse with safety stock."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","There’s also a greater difficulty in measuring the financial impact. And if you don’t know how much something will cost, you’re entering into unknown territory. Which is a risky place to take your supply chain."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","A difficulty you may face in analysing the right form of approach is working out whether the absorb or respond strategy is the best course of action."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","In most situations, the best solution is usually a combination of both."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","However, it should be a strategic choice, depending on your market strategy and other factors like margin and the criticality of the product."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","But that’s not always an easy thing to spot. Like any other supply chain decision, the trade-off is driven by cost versus benefit."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Creating a responsive supply chain requires a thought-provoking exercise to imagine all the events that might hinder your operation."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","As I mentioned above, however, planning for disasters doesn’t imply having one distinct plan for each."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","There’s obviously a distinct physical difference between walking into a warehouse impacted by a flood and a fire, but the impact on business may be similar."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Entering unknown territory is always easier if there’s a map and compass to guide you."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","More importantly, providing the people, processes and even the supporting technology with a common focus will pay dividends."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Building the right supply chain strategy then requires:"
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Combining the above information to design a winning supply chain."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","The result of the disruption’s far more important than the actual disruption itself."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Therefore, it’s not required to have a distinct strategy for every type of disruption. In fact, it’s better to group disasters by potential impact."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Sure, fire and water are different entities. But the impact of either at your manufacturing plant will be different in impact to one at your retail stores."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","As mapping all possible disruptions and designing a strategy for each is virtually impossible, it’s a good idea to group disruptions by the scale of impact and duration."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Where does a small fire in the warehouse rank to raging wildfires in the location of your most popular stores?"
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","How does a minor delay in shipping rank to a block in the Suez canal?"
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","One idea to help your ranking system is to classify impact by local, national or global brackets, and classify its impact as either temporary or long-term."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Not every product within your assortment requires the same strategy."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","When designing effective supply chain resilience strategies, a logical place to start is proactively categorising inventory."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","For example, if a supplier of one of your C-items is hit by an outbreak of flu, your response strategy will be different. Perhaps, you just have to make do until the supplier gets back up and running."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","However, if a supplier of one of your A-items suddenly goes out of business, it should be all hands on deck."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","By working in this way, you won’t waste time with discussion or indecision on which products in your portfolio to prioritise for recovery."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","As modern supply chains are globalised and interwoven, there are few nodes left that are fully autonomous."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","A model that can help you manage this complexity is the Kraljic matrix (all be it with a slight twist)."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","The criticality of a product and the complexity of its supply determine what strategy to take when working with vendors."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","For example, products or raw materials that are critical and have a supply constraint require planning for long-term availability and having great relationships with tier-1 vendors."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","If you a supplier of one of your C-items is hit by an outbreak of flu, your response strategy will be different. Perhaps, you just have to make do until the supplier gets back up and running."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","In many cases, collaborative relationships with vendors will pay off massively."

supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Some costs you should factor in for comparative purposes:"
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","When introducing more advanced concepts such as concurrent and postponed manufacturing, there might also be benefits for day-to-day operational costs."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","It’s also worth adding that you can not be sure your supply chain plans are watertight until you have crunched the numbers and explored a few potential scenarios."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Contemplating disaster scenarios is a sobering process."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Even worse than this though is disaster striking and you realise you’ve not given a moment’s thought to a contingency plan; Especially in a resource-intensive business like yours."

supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Both natural and man-made disasters aren’t stopping any time soon."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Absorbing or buffering against disasters can be expensive. But it’s a cost that’s worth its weight if it secures your long-term success or even survival."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","A playbook that centres around communication and rapid execution is the gold standard in supply chain resilience planning."

supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","It creates an opportunity to share investments in absorbing shocks or responding quicker."
supply-chain-management/,"paragraph","Both approaches in this article require close collaboration with suppliers and customers to guard against adverse events. By doing both, you’ll protect your supply chain and ensure products can flow with the least amount of disruption."

operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","Operational efficiency is a company’s ability to do more with less: optimising resources, processes, and time to maximise productivity and reduce costs, all without compromising the quality of products or services. This involves eliminating anything that doesn’t add value, cutting waste, and leveraging technology to make everything more agile and effective."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","This concept can vary depending on the area of the business. For example, in retail, the focus is on dynamic inventory management and providing a better customer experience. In distribution, it’s about logistics accuracy and route optimisation. In manufacturing, the priority is to boost productivity while maintaining strict quality control."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","Achieving greater operational efficiency not only improves financial outcomes but also enables businesses to adapt to changing customer demands and position themselves as leaders in their industry."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","In this article, we’ll explore the challenges businesses face and highlight key strategies to achieve operational efficiency throughout the supply chain."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","First and foremost, it’s important to recognise that achieving operational efficiency becomes more challenging as a business grows and evolves. In its early stages, most businesses operate with a simple, linear supply chain model, often managing stock from a single central warehouse."

operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are vital for  measuring the performance of the supply chain  and inventory management. Achieving operational efficiency requires defining and continuously monitoring these metrics to evaluate processes and make informed decisions for ongoing improvement. Below are some of the most relevant KPIs in this context:"
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","This KPI measures how effectively a company meets customer demand—essentially, the percentage of times a product is available when needed. High availability reflects good planning and inventory management, boosting customer trust and enhancing the shopping experience."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","Inventory Turnover  indicates how quickly products are sold and restocked. High turnover suggests strong demand and efficient management, while reducing the risk of obsolescence. However, balance is key: overly high turnover may indicate insufficient inventory, while low turnover could mean excess stock and unnecessary costs."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","This KPI includes all expenses associated with holding and managing stock, such as storage, insurance, and depreciation. Efficiently managing these costs helps the company become more profitable and resourceful."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","This KPI assesses whether customer orders are delivered on time and without errors. Delivering as promised builds trust and enhances the perception of quality. Failures in this area highlight process gaps that need addressing to remove obstacles and improve overall efficiency."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","Have a look at the complete article on  On Time in Full (OTIF)  to dive deeper into this KPI."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","In summary, the key to efficient operations lies in measuring, understanding, and acting on these KPIs. It’s about leveraging information to make smart decisions, drive continuous improvement, and keep customers satisfied."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","Deciding between a “push” or “pull” inventory management model is crucial for supply chain success and operational efficiency."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","An operational excellence model in inventory management is often a customized combination of both approaches, where inventory is dynamically adjusted to the specific needs of each point in the supply chain. By tailoring this combination to the actual requirements of each location, companies achieve superior efficiency and optimize their resources."

operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","To optimise the supply chain and manage inventory effectively, it’s essential to follow a structured process that enables continuous improvement. Here’s how to get started:"
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","Identify the most valuable products and focus efforts on these key items, reducing complexity and maintenance costs."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","Stock management rules based on demand, profitability, and sales frequency criteria ensure that only key products remain in inventory. This approach avoids unnecessary storage issues and allows for a more agile response to market demand."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","In this context, businesses should avoid applying a one-size-fits-all approach to all products in stock. Differentiating service levels enables the management of each product according to its strategic importance and impact on the business:"
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","Every item follows its unique product lifecycle, from market introduction to decline and eventual discontinuation. Each stage requires distinct stock management strategies:"
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) is a key tool for optimising order sizes and minimising inventory costs. By balancing ordering costs and holding costs, companies can reduce expenses while maintaining product availability."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","We suggest you take a look at this  article on the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)  to learn more about this topic."

operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","Read Desigual’s full success story with Slimstock"
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","To achieve greater operational efficiency, it’s crucial to adopt a systematic approach to  stock management . This involves implementing well-defined processes that eliminate waste, optimise workflows, and ultimately enable better decision-making."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","One of the biggest challenges for businesses, especially for operations departments, is the constant need to resolve operational issues – a practice often referred to as “firefighting”. This reactive management style is not only inefficient but can also be exhausting for operations teams. A more proactive approach, on the other hand, provides a preventive and strategic framework that allows the operations department to address problems before they arise, maintaining control over stock flows and improving the experience for both the team and customers."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","To put the concepts we’ve discussed into practice within a business, it’s advisable to start with a small group of high-relevance products to test the benefits, and then gradually expand the approach to the entire range. This method allows companies to focus on those products that contribute most to their profit margins, optimising processes in a controlled and gradual manner."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","Here are some ideas to get you started:"
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","So far, we’ve looked at the general aspects of operational efficiency. However, the operations of each company can vary significantly depending on factors such as the industry and its role in the supply chain. This means there are key differences depending on whether a company is a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer. Let’s take a closer look at these differences."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","Operational efficiency in the manufacturing sector focuses on maximising productivity, optimising resource use, and reducing costs across the entire production chain. For a manufacturing company, operational efficiency means achieving the optimal balance between quality, production speed, and the control of raw materials and finished product inventories."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","Operational efficiency in manufacturing starts with optimising the production processes. This includes the implementation of methodologies such as Lean Manufacturing and Six Sigma, which help to reduce waste, minimise errors, and maximise efficiency at each stage of production. These methodologies enable companies to identify and eliminate activities that do not add value, thereby improving overall plant productivity."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","In manufacturing, efficient management of raw materials and component inventories is crucial to avoid production disruptions. Manufacturing companies may sometimes implement Just-In-Time (JIT) inventory systems, which ensure that raw materials are delivered exactly when needed, reducing storage and associated costs."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","Effective inventory management ensures that the necessary materials are always available to maintain production flow without stopping the lines or accumulating excessive stock."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","To improve efficiency, manufacturing companies often implement advanced technologies and automation systems in their production lines. These tools not only speed up processes but also ensure greater accuracy and consistency in manufacturing."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","The modern industry has introduced tools such as collaborative robots, real-time monitoring systems, and IoT technology, which allow manufacturers to manage each stage of production more precisely and adapt quickly to changes in demand or product design."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","Quality management is essential in manufacturing to ensure that products meet customer standards and expectations. Manufacturers implement stringent quality controls at each production stage to identify and correct defects before the product reaches the end customer. This practice not only reduces waste and reprocessing costs but also ensures a reputation for quality and reliability."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","To achieve operational efficiency, manufacturing companies need to plan and schedule production based on demand, resource usage, and plant capacity. This includes shift scheduling, production planning according to sales forecasts, and managing downtime for preventive maintenance. Good planning helps avoid disruptions, optimises machinery use, and ensures smooth, continuous production."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","Operational   efficiency  in  retail   is   characterised   by  a  strong   focus   on   the   end   customer ,  which   requires   dynamic ,  consumer-oriented   management .  Inventory   management   is   key   to   maintaining   smooth   operations ,  reducing   costs , and  enhancing   customer   satisfaction ."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","Unlike manufacturers and distributors, retailers must maintain inventories that are closely aligned with the demand of the end consumer. In retail, demand variability is constant, which forces businesses to continuously monitor trends and adjust stock levels at each point of sale based on customer needs. This means responding quickly and accurately to changes in demand, which can involve frequent restocking or redistributing products to specific stores based on local buying patterns."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","Proximity to the end customer requires a much more agile and precise restocking process than in other parts of the supply chain. Unlike manufacturing, where the focus is typically on producing large quantities at the lowest cost, retail needs flexibility and speed to respond to real-time demand. Retailers, especially those with multiple outlets, must coordinate their inventory between stores, distribution centres, and warehouses continuously to avoid both surplus and stockouts at each location."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","In retail, especially in sectors like food, managing shelf life and minimising waste is a critical operational difference compared to manufacturing and distribution. Products must be available at the right time to maximise their freshness and shelf life for the consumer. This requires efficient management of expiration dates and local inventory control, optimising product rotation to minimise losses due to obsolescence."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","Digitalisation and the rise of omnichannel retail are two key factors that cannot be overlooked when discussing operational efficiency in retail. Modern retail integrates multiple sales channels and customer touchpoints, such as online sales, click-and-collect, or in-store shipping. This demands highly synchronised operations across these channels to deliver a seamless shopping experience. In this context, technology enables inventory visibility and optimises product flow based on the customer’s preferred shopping channel."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","Operational efficiency in the distribution sector has its own unique characteristics that set it apart from retail and manufacturing. For a distribution company, the focus is on optimising the flow of products between manufacturers and retailers, ensuring that inventory is managed swiftly and accurately to meet the demands of both sides of the supply chain."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","Unlike retail, where the focus is on presenting products to the end customer, distribution companies handle large volumes of inventory intended for multiple clients across different locations. Operational efficiency in distribution requires robust systems to manage large-scale inventories, ensuring accuracy in the management of quantities, locations, and shipping schedules."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","Logistics efficiency is crucial for distribution companies, as their operations depend on fast and effective deliveries to retailers, secondary distributors, or end customers in geographically dispersed areas. Unlike retail businesses, which focus on the in-store customer experience, distributors need to optimise delivery routes and schedules to reduce transport costs and maximise punctuality."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","Given that distribution companies typically manage much larger inventory volumes than retailers, warehouse automation is a key strategy to improve operational efficiency. Implementing automated picking systems, along with smart storage technologies, allows distributors to process orders quickly and with minimal human intervention, reducing errors and preparation times."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","Distribution companies must carefully manage their cycle times, as any delay can affect not only their relationship with retailers but also with manufacturers. The cycle time in distribution refers to the total time it takes from receiving products into the warehouse to final delivery. An efficient distribution cycle involves minimising handling, storage, and transport times."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","Unlike retailers, who operate in a B2C environment, distribution companies primarily manage B2B relationships, working closely with both manufacturers and retailers. Effective management of these relationships is essential to ensure a continuous flow of products and maintain an adequate service level. Distributors need to coordinate efficiently with suppliers in terms of demand forecasting, production scheduling, and delivery times, while ensuring that retailers receive products in line with their needs."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","In today’s highly competitive environment, operational efficiency is essential for any company aiming to lead its respective sector. Regardless of the industry or position within the supply chain, achieving excellence in operations is the only way to control costs while delivering the best possible service to customers."

operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","Operational efficiency refers to a company’s ability to optimise resources, reduce costs, and maximise productivity in its processes. By minimising waste and improving workflow, businesses can deliver high-quality products or services in a quick and cost-effective manner, resulting in a more competitive operation focused on meeting customer needs."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","Operational efficiency is achieved through process optimisation, waste reduction, and the smart use of resources. This involves implementing advanced technology, automating repetitive tasks, and applying methodologies like Lean or Six Sigma to improve quality and reduce errors. Additionally, effective planning, continuous performance monitoring, and adapting to market demands are essential to maintain an agile and competitive operation."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","Technology is key to achieving operational efficiency as it enables process automation, improves accuracy, and reduces execution times. Tools such as data analytics, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things (IoT) facilitate real-time monitoring and data-driven decision-making. This optimises resource usage, reduces errors, and allows for a swift response to changes in demand, ultimately improving productivity and reducing costs."
operational-efficiency/,"paragraph","Businesses face several challenges in achieving operational efficiency, including resistance to organisational change, a lack of training in new technologies and processes, and the need for investment in infrastructure and technological tools. Additionally, the complexity of coordination between departments, managing real-time data, and adapting to constant changes in demand can also hinder the ability to achieve a truly optimised and competitive operation."

capacity-planning/,"paragraph","For all companies, customer satisfaction is fundamental for success. Exceed customer expectations and you will reap the rewards of recurring income through increased loyalty and improved brand image. Better still, you can attract new customers through word-of-mouth… For these reasons, a  high level of service  – being able to deliver the product your customer requests in time, and to the agreed quantity – is a priority for any business."
capacity-planning/,"paragraph","For distributors and retailers, this means it is necessary to have sufficient capacity: stock to meet  demand , a sufficient workforce, and the necessary equipment and infrastructure to achieve this. In the case of manufacturing companies, there is also the added complexity of having to carry out a process that transforms raw materials and/or semi-finished products into the final article or finished product."
capacity-planning/,"paragraph","In the quest to achieve these objectives, companies have a capacity that they cannot exceed due to various constraints. The higher this capacity, the more prepared the organisation will be to respond to peaks in demand without fear of losing sales. But at the same time, it will have to face higher fixed costs. To find the break-even point, there is capacity planning, which is what we will talk about in this article."
capacity-planning/,"paragraph","Balance is always a virtue, and capacity planning is no exception. Planning for maximums will result in overcapacity that will cost your company dearly. By the same token, planning too “lean” may mean that you will not be able to meet demand. What you can be sure of, however, is that both situations are detrimental to your company."
capacity-planning/,"paragraph","Capacity planning seeks to find a balance. Therefore, we can define capacity planning as the process of determining the amount of resources needed to meet future demand for products or services. This approach seeks to balance the availability of resources with demand, ensuring that a business can operate efficiently without incurring excesses or shortages."
capacity-planning/,"paragraph","The factors to be taken into account when carrying out capacity planning are diverse:"
capacity-planning/,"paragraph","<img decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone wp-image-1989836 size-full"" title=""What is capacity planning"" src=""https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/capacity-planning-table.webp"" alt=""What is capacity planning"" width=""907"" height=""768"" srcset=""https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/capacity-planning-table.webp 907w, https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/capacity-planning-table-300x254.webp 300w, https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/capacity-planning-table-768x650.webp 768w, https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/capacity-planning-table-283x240.webp 283w"" sizes=""(max-width: 907px) 100vw, 907px"">"
capacity-planning/,"paragraph","This is perhaps the most elementary point of capacity planning, because if you have no idea what your demand will be, it is practically impossible to correctly plan the capacity you need. In order to forecast demand as accurately as possible, you should take into account historical data, market information, seasonal fluctuations, and other important metrics."
capacity-planning/,"paragraph","Your capacity as a company will also be closely related to the available hands and whether your workforce has the training and skills necessary to achieve your objectives."
capacity-planning/,"paragraph","In the context of capacity planning, technology and equipment play crucial roles. In the case of manufacturing companies, production capacity is directly related to the quality and condition of your machines and tools. If your equipment is obsolete or not in a good state of maintenance, your capacity will be compromised. At retailers and distributors, better technology and equipment also translates into more efficiency and therefore higher capacity."
capacity-planning/,"paragraph","Infrastructure, which includes both the size and design of facilities, is another determining factor in capacity planning. The physical limitations of your plant, distribution centre or shops (among others) may restrict your ability to increase capacity, even if other resources are available. Efficient design can improve workflow. Assessing and planning for future infrastructure expansions is also key to ensuring that you can scale operations when needed."
capacity-planning/,"paragraph","For manufacturers, the  availability  and quality of raw materials is also essential for maintaining maximal production capacity. Disruptions in the supply of materials can cause production stoppages, negatively affecting the ability to meet demand."
capacity-planning/,"paragraph","The financial aspect cannot be ignored in capacity planning. It is necessary to ensure that financial resources are aligned with capacity plans. This includes having an adequate budget for the acquisition of machinery, hiring of personnel, and maintenance of infrastructure. The financial health of the company therefore influences its capacity."
capacity-planning/,"paragraph","Capacity planning must be aligned with the company’s overall strategy. If the strategy is for aggressive growth, capacity must be planned to support it. This implies not only having the necessary resources, but also the flexibility to adjust capacity according to market opportunities. The long-term goals of the company should guide capacity decisions to ensure everything is focused on the same objectives."
capacity-planning/,"paragraph","Inventory management  is also relevant to capacity planning. Maintaining adequate stock levels ensures that demand can be met without incurring excessive costs or risks of obsolescence."
capacity-planning/,"paragraph","The capacity planning process can be divided into several phases."
capacity-planning/,"paragraph","Determine the current production capacity, including human resources, machinery, facilities, and technology. Similarly, the company’s constraints and bottlenecks should also be identified."
capacity-planning/,"paragraph","As mentioned above,  demand forecasting  is a critical phase in capacity planning. Without an accurate estimate of future demand, any capacity plan will be ineffective."
capacity-planning/,"paragraph","Developing capacity strategies involves deciding how the identified capacity requirements will be met. Here, you will explore different approaches, such as increasing operational efficiency, investing in new machinery, hiring more staff, or outsourcing part of the production or other processes."
capacity-planning/,"paragraph","With the strategy in hand, it is time to put the plan into action. Implementing the capacity plan may involve acquiring new equipment, reorganising production lines, training additional staff, or expanding facilities. This step requires careful coordination to minimise disruption to your existing operations. To achieve this, it is advisable to have a detailed timeline and assign clear responsibilities to ensure that all aspects of the plan are executed efficiently."
capacity-planning/,"paragraph","Once the capacity plan is implemented, continuous monitoring and control is essential to ensure its effectiveness. This involves tracking production levels, resource utilisation, and key performance indicators ( KPIs ) to detect any deviations from the plan."
capacity-planning/,"paragraph","Capacity planning is not a static process; it requires constant review and adjustment. After a period of implementation, it is necessary to evaluate the plan’s performance and collect feedback from the different departments involved. Analyse whether production targets have been achieved and whether resources have been used efficiently. When you draw conclusions, make the necessary adjustments to the capacity plan."
capacity-planning/,"paragraph","Efficiency can be assessed through different KPIs that help to get an idea of how optimal an organisation’s capacity planning is:"
capacity-planning/,"paragraph","A metric that measures the degree to which a company uses its installed production capacity. It indicates what percentage of the total available capacity is actually being used for the production of goods or services."
capacity-planning/,"paragraph","A high level of capacity utilisation generally indicates an efficient operation, while a low level may suggest underutilisation of resources or potential to increase production without additional investment."

capacity-planning/,"paragraph","Capacity planning is a process that cannot be understood in isolation. After all, it is a single cog that must be integrated with other business processes in the wider business machine to ensure effective resource management and alignment with objectives. So how does it integrate with the other processes within a company and what is its impact?"
capacity-planning/,"paragraph","In this blog, we have repeatedly discussed the importance of maintaining balanced stock levels to allow the company to meet demand and deliver the level of service it aims to provide while not incurring overstocking costs or excessive obsolescence risks."
capacity-planning/,"paragraph","Well, in the case of capacity, it is exactly the same. A lack of capacity will result in lost sales and an excess in an oversized structure that is not efficient. And it is through capacity planning that organisations can regulate their capacity to find a balance."
capacity-planning/,"paragraph","Factors influencing a company’s capacity include human resources, technology and equipment, its infrastructure, availability, and its financial situation, among others."
capacity-planning/,"paragraph","Capacity planning ensures a company can meet market demand without incurring excessive costs or missing sales opportunities. Capacity planning optimises resource utilisation, improves operational efficiency, and facilitates decision-making, contributing to business profitability and sustainability."
capacity-planning/,"paragraph","Much depends on the nature of the company’s business. However, we can consider that some of the usual profiles involved in capacity planning can be the operations manager, the production manager, the demand planning team, and the human resources manager."
capacity-planning/,"paragraph","Challenges can arise during the capacity planning process, such as accurate demand forecasting, which is essential to avoid over- or under-capacity. Managing limited resources, including labour and raw materials, can also complicate planning. Unexpected changes in the market or disruptions in the supply chain can similarly destabilise projections."

supply-chain-trends-for-2025/,"paragraph","The rise of integrated ecosystems connects suppliers, customers, and consumers within a collaborative network. Real-time data sharing improves transparency, risk-sharing, and agility in decision-making. This interconnectedness empowers organisations to respond swiftly to changes, fostering more resilient and optimised supply chain operations."
supply-chain-trends-for-2025/,"paragraph","Digital twins , virtual replicas of physical operations, are becoming essential tools for SCM. These models simulate complex scenarios, such as supply disruptions, extreme weather, or logistical challenges, allowing organisations to prepare for and mitigate risks effectively. By 2025, companies without digital twin technology may find themselves at a disadvantage compared to competitors adept at navigating disruptions."
supply-chain-trends-for-2025/,"paragraph","Blockchain technology is increasingly adopted in supply chains requiring authenticity and transparency, such as food and pharmaceutical sectors. By offering end-to-end traceability—from raw materials to the end consumer—blockchain adds value to products while ensuring compliance with international regulations.

reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","Reverse logistics  is a crucial aspect of the modern supply chain. This process, which includes product returns and waste management, presents operational challenges but also strategic opportunities to enhance efficiency and improve business outcomes."
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","In this article, we will delve into how effective management of reverse logistics can set your business apart from the competition."
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","Reverse logistics refers to the flow of products from the end consumer back to the manufacturer or distributor. This process can involve returning defective items, handling commercial returns, recycling materials, or reusing components."
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","In an ideal world, there would be no need for this reverse flow. However, the reality is that a certain rate of product returns is unavoidable. Businesses that master this process not only reduce costs but also enhance customer satisfaction and strengthen their competitiveness."
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","Let’s set the scene: the customer has purchased a product but decides it isn’t right for them and wants to return it. Naturally, this represents a setback for the seller. Once this has occurred, the goal is to recover the item as quickly as possible and, if feasible, resell it. Before reaching this stage of “resale,” there are several key phases to navigate."
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","The first phase involves accepting returns from customers. Depending on a company’s policy, this may include defective, damaged, or simply unwanted products. It is essential to have an efficient collection system or provide physical locations where customers can return items."
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","After receiving returned products, they need to be sorted and assessed. Some items may be reusable, others might require repairs or refurbishment, and some may no longer be usable and will need to be disposed of."
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","At this stage, products that can be refurbished or repaired are restored to their optimal condition. This may include repairing components, cleaning, repackaging, or any other action necessary to make the product fit for resale. If the item can be restored and resold, this would typically be the final stage of reverse logistics. If not, additional steps are required."
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","For products that cannot be refurbished or have reached the end of their useful life, they are dismantled to recover valuable materials where possible. This promotes resource reuse, waste reduction, and supports a circular economy. If no valuable materials can be salvaged, the remaining items are recycled where feasible."
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","Products or materials that cannot be recycled or reused must be disposed of in compliance with current regulations."
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","One of the greatest enablers of reverse logistics is technology.  Advanced supply chain management systems  work with two key concepts in reverse logistics management: demand forecasting and product coverage."
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","Demand forecasting  provides accurate insights into future product needs, while product coverage indicates the amount of stock available in relation to projected demand. Together, these tools enable informed decisions regarding the handling of returned products."
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","For instance, if a returned item has high projected demand, it could be placed in picking locations to be quickly dispatched to another customer. If demand is low, the product could be stored in secondary locations or included in promotions. Additionally, robust technology systems can identify return patterns to reduce future errors."
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","The implementation of such technologies also allows data integration across departments, facilitating better coordination throughout the organisation. This collaboration is essential for maximising the value of reverse logistics."
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","<img decoding=""async"" id=""hs-cta-img-7f60b0d1-e89c-42ff-8c1b-3e34e009bbff"" class=""hs-cta-img"" style=""border-width: 0px;"" src=""https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/7651234/7f60b0d1-e89c-42ff-8c1b-3e34e009bbff.png"" alt=""New call-to-action"">  hbspt.cta.load(7651234, '7f60b0d1-e89c-42ff-8c1b-3e34e009bbff', {""useNewLoader"":""true"",""region"":""na1""});"
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","To illustrate how reverse logistics is applied in real-world scenarios, let’s review some notable examples – organised by industry – where reverse logistics adds value to business operations:"
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","Global brands quickly remove poorly selling products from certain regions to redistribute them to stores where they are in higher demand. This approach maximises sales and reduces waste."
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","Companies in this sector offer return programmes to recycle end-of-life products, recovering valuable materials such as metals and plastics. These initiatives simultaneously encourage customers to upgrade their devices."
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","Supermarket chains manage returns of non-perishable food items by redirecting them to food banks or donation programmes, yielding significant reputational benefits for the brand."
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","E-commerce  giants have implemented automated processes that make it easier for customers to return products, automatically sorting them for refurbishment or recycling depending on their condition."
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","These examples demonstrate how businesses can turn a challenge into a competitive advantage by adopting strategies tailored to their sector and specific needs."
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","Companies face various challenges depending on their structure and  logistics network . Below, we describe three typical scenarios:"
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","In companies operating with a single warehouse, returns are usually managed centrally. Integrating demand forecasting with the Warehouse Management System (WMS) can automate the sorting of returned products. For instance, high-turnover items can be placed in easily accessible areas, while low-demand items are allocated to less critical storage zones."

reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","Implementing an effective and efficient reverse logistics strategy offers multiple advantages for businesses:"
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","If not managed properly, reverse logistics can lead to high operational costs and challenges in inventory handling. However, with the right strategies, businesses can significantly mitigate these negative impacts and turn reverse logistics into a competitive advantage. How can this be achieved?"
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","Efficient management of the forward flow (downstream) can significantly reduce returns. This includes the correct  inventory allocation  across warehouses and sales points, as well as the use of systems to automate supply and replenishment based on demand patterns."
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","Poor initial distribution is often one of the main triggers of returns, making it crucial to get this phase right. Regular analysis of inventory coverage and adjustments to minimise surpluses or shortages are equally important."
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","Recording and analysing the reasons behind returns can reveal valuable patterns. For instance, if a recurring issue is linked to a specific defect, the company can address it at the production or design stage."
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","This data can also be used to train the sales team and enhance customer communication, reducing returns caused by unmet expectations."
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","Classifying products based on their contribution to revenue and their volatility allows for prioritised efforts. High-revenue and high-volatility items typically account for the majority of returns, requiring closer monitoring."
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","Companies that have implemented effective segmentation strategies have managed to reduce returns by up to 20%, thanks to a more targeted approach to products that generate the most returns."
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","As we’ve explored throughout this article, managing reverse logistics involves a certain level of complexity. It comprises various phases, some of which may rely on external providers, such as the handling of returns."
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","However, this complexity is a shared challenge across your industry. Therefore, by efficiently managing the entire process, the challenge of reverse logistics can be transformed into a competitive advantage. As we’ve seen, the potential benefits are substantial—from reducing operational costs to improving customer satisfaction and, consequently, strengthening your brand image."
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","Reverse  logistics   is  fundamental  to   the  circular  economy , as  it   facilitates   the   reuse ,  repair , and  recycling   of   products ,  closing   the   lifecycle   of   materials .  It   promotes   sustainable   practices   that  reduce  environmental   impact  and  resource   waste ."
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","One of the primary challenges of reverse logistics is the complexity of coordinating return flows across multiple points of origin and destination. This requires advanced technology to manage data and predict patterns effectively."
reverse-logistics/,"paragraph","Additionally, the costs associated with the transportation and storage of returned products can be significant if processes are not optimised. Another key challenge is compliance with environmental and recycling regulations, which vary by region and can create legal and operational complications."

the-art-of-implementing-sop/,"paragraph","Last updated: August 20, 2024 | 3"
the-art-of-implementing-sop/,"paragraph","Table of contents"
the-art-of-implementing-sop/,"paragraph","Many companies implement  Sales & Operations Planning  (S&OP), but what they don’t realise is that S&OP goes way beyond processes and systems. ‘You have to deal with clashing interests, emotions and people who have different mindsets,’ says Slimstock’s Sales Director Jan Kraaijeveld. In his eyes, S&OP is where art and science meet."
the-art-of-implementing-sop/,"paragraph","Companies are increasingly aware that their success depends on the effectiveness of the  supply chain , Jan Kraaijeveld observes. ‘You can offer beautiful products and set up the flashiest marketing campaigns, but if you cannot then deliver, everything stops. And the impact is clear: without the right stock, revenues take a direct hit.’"
the-art-of-implementing-sop/,"paragraph","Due to the level of  global disruption  we’ve seen in recent years, executives have also learnt that to ensure reliable performance, they need to plan further ahead. ‘The days of rush orders and short-cycle thinking are over. Companies need to start thinking more long-term, look at what is coming, and make a plan for how they are going to meet  demand .’"
the-art-of-implementing-sop/,"paragraph","Kraaijeveld continues: ‘Our clients have now got their operational  inventory management  in order and are implementing S&OP on a large scale. An important part of this is  scenario planning ."
the-art-of-implementing-sop/,"paragraph","Customer purchasing behaviour has become more erratic, so forecasts can no longer be based on historical sales data alone. Companies want to launch products and enter new markets. But they also need to prepare for disruptions. Within S&OP, you have  processes  and techniques with which you bring the information about this together and translate it into the right choices at management level.’"
the-art-of-implementing-sop/,"paragraph","But S&OP is much more than introducing processes and systems. People determine the real success, according to the Sales Director. ‘S&OP is about getting Sales, Production, Finance, Purchasing and all other departments to come to a consensus."
the-art-of-implementing-sop/,"paragraph","That does involve a bit more than what is written about S&OP in textbooks. This is about change management, dealing with emotions, bridging cultural differences. What makes S&OP extra challenging is that every company has to implement it in its own way. What works well in one company may turn out totally wrong in another. And the pitfall here is that people lapse into operational issues.’"
the-art-of-implementing-sop/,"paragraph","In his view, S&OP should be considered not only as a science but also as an ‘art’. The art of including the human factor within the process. The art of getting parties on the same page and arriving at creative solutions. ‘We also have a lot of knowledge about this, which we share with our clients, such as through training courses and master classes."
the-art-of-implementing-sop/,"paragraph","We also like to bring clients into contact with other companies, so that they can learn from peers what the practical pitfalls are. Good inventory management is about people, processes and  technology , and that applies to S&OP all the way. S&OP is a combination of science and art, and at Slimstock, we want to facilitate both aspects as much as possible. Only then can our customers outperform.’"
the-art-of-implementing-sop/,"paragraph","S&OP integrates sales forecasts with operational strategies to achieve alignment and efficiency across the supply chain."
the-art-of-implementing-sop/,"paragraph","S&OP requires not only rigorous data-driven analysis (science) but also adept management of human factors and organizational dynamics (art)."
the-art-of-implementing-sop/,"paragraph","S&OP enables businesses to plan proactively, anticipating and mitigating the impact of global disruptions on supply chain performance."
the-art-of-implementing-sop/,"paragraph","Change management is crucial in S&OP as it involves aligning diverse departments and overcoming cultural barriers to foster consensus and operational efficiency."
the-art-of-implementing-sop/,"paragraph","Companies can optimize S&OP by leveraging scenario planning, adapting strategies to customer behavior shifts, and integrating best practices tailored to their specific organizational needs."

cross-docking/,"paragraph","To  stock or not to stock ? That is the question. In this blog, we will explore how to optimise your supply chain through accurate calculations of  safety stock  and  EOQ , among other essential strategies for efficient inventory management."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","However, there are times when stock can be unnecessary—or at least reduced to a minimum. We saw this in a recent article on the  JIT  method, where a manufacturer receives supplies directly from its suppliers with virtually no inventory. Today, we’ll focus on cross-docking, a technique where products are received in a warehouse and then quickly distributed with minimal handling and without being stored."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","The literal translation of “cross-docking” gives us a good idea of the concept. In a cross-docking strategy, products—whether raw materials, components, or finished goods—arrive at the warehouse and, without being stored, are loaded onto transport vehicles for delivery to the end customer or shop. Essentially, these goods are never placed on the distribution centre shelves; they simply “cross the loading dock” of the warehouse."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","The fundamentals of cross-docking are relatively straightforward. First, you need a distribution centre with inbound and outbound doors to receive goods from suppliers and ship orders to customers or stores."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","The cross-docking process occurs in this hub or distribution centre and consists of several stages:"
cross-docking/,"paragraph","Receipt of goods:  Products arrive at the distribution centre and trucks unload the products in the designated areas."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","Classification and preparation:  Goods are sorted according to their final destination. This process may include specific control tasks such as checking the quality and quantity of the goods."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","Transfer:  Products are transferred from the receiving area to the shipping areas."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","Loading and shipping:  Products are loaded onto lorries destined for the points of sale or the end customer."

cross-docking/,"paragraph","It may seem obvious, but reducing the time goods spend in the warehouse to a minimum has many benefits. And it is precisely these benefits that cross-docking is all about. Let’s review some of these benefits."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","Prolonged storage is avoided as goods are quickly distributed, which can reduce  inventory costs ."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","With cross-docking, the level of handling is reduced, lowering the risk of damage and loss. The cross-docking operation is typically far more agile by eliminating the put-away step of the operations process."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","Lead times  are improved by eliminating intermediate storage stages. This means products can reach their final destination faster, resulting in better service and greater customer satisfaction."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","Products do not remain in the warehouse for a long time, improving  inventory turnover  and other  KPIs  linked to stock management."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","Cross-docking fosters high-level coordination between suppliers, warehouses, and carriers, optimizing the entire supply chain. This streamlined process reduces handling time, minimizes storage needs, and accelerates product flow, leading to increased efficiency in supply chain management ( SCM )."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","Cross-docking comes in two main types, depending on how orders are prepared and the processes carried out in the distribution centre."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","In this model, products arrive at the distribution centre sorted and labelled for their final destination. They are pre-grouped according to specific orders before reaching the centre. Handling is minimal, as the distribution centre simply transfers the products from the receiving area to the shipping area without any additional sorting."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","Products arrive at the distribution centre in large batches and are then consolidated into new shipments based on the end customer’s needs. Unlike pre-distributed cross-docking, this method requires more processing and organisation within the distribution centre. It involves additional handling, including sorting, labelling, and consolidating products into various shipments."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","The consolidated model is, therefore, more complex and flexible as it allows for the creation of more customised orders for the customer."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","Any product can be distributed by cross-docking. However, there are some types of goods for which this method is used more frequently because they need to be distributed quickly."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","Fresh foods such as fruits, vegetables, meats, fish and dairy products must be kept fresh and have a  short shelf life . Flowers and plants would also be included in this category."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","FMCG products such as beverages, snacks, cleaning products and toiletries that are in high demand and sell out quickly. Also, mobile phones, computers and other electronic devices have  short life cycles  and tight and demanding launch dates in shops or markets."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","Clothing and accessories that are  seasonally  fashionable and need to be available quickly in shops. Also, items are launched for special  promotions , events, or holidays with limited sales."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","Medicines requiring rapid delivery to maintain efficacy, including vaccines and biologicals. Also, medical supplies and equipment are needed for emergencies or high demand."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","Items purchased by the customer on e-commerce platforms need to be prepared and shipped quickly to meet users’ expectations regarding delivery times."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","Mail companies are experts in forwarding systems. Parcels are picked up in vans from the origin and grouped at the hubs according to destination for transport in trailers. These trailers are deconsolidated at the destination, and the goods are put back into vans for home delivery."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","Cross-docking offers many advantages but has limitations and challenges that can impact its implementation and maintenance."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","Advanced warehouse management systems (WMS) and tracking technologies are required to coordinate the receipt and shipment of goods efficiently. This means that the initial investment to get it up and running can be high."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","Forget about implementing a cross-docking strategy if you cannot coordinate effectively with the other links in the supply chain. You must synchronise with suppliers, customers and carriers to ensure that products arrive on time."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","By the very nature of cross-docking, warehouse space will be limited. If the system runs smoothly, there will be no problems, but if there are delays in the supply chain or unexpected peaks in demand, the capacity of the infrastructure may be strained."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","Some products, such as fragile or dangerous goods, may require unique and less hasty handling that complicates cross-docking."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","Problems at any point in the supply chain, such as supplier delivery delays, can significantly impact cross-docking efficiency. Similarly, as in JIT, the dependence on your suppliers and carriers is very high."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","Cross-docking can be less flexible in the face of sudden changes in demand compared to more traditional distribution models."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","The implementation and operation of cross-docking can be complex, requiring detailed planning and ongoing management to ensure its effectiveness. It needs constant monitoring and adjustments to optimise processes and respond to changing market and supply chain dynamics."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","The truth is that holding and maintaining  stock  is costly and risky. Therefore, all processes that allow inventory to be reduced – as long as they do not affect the level of service – are a good idea to gain efficiency, reduce costs and free up  working capital ."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","However, organisations don’t hold stock on a whim; they do so to manage fluctuating  demand  and unexpected events in the supply chain while maintaining  service levels ."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","Therefore, cross-docking should be seen as a technique to enhance agility in operations, improve efficiency, and achieve optimal  stock levels ."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","A warehouse equipped for cross-docking must have a design that facilitates the fast and efficient flow of products, with clearly defined areas for receiving and dispatching goods. It must have advanced inventory management and tracking technology, accessible and sufficient loading and unloading spaces, trained personnel and machinery to handle fast operations and infrastructure for minimal product handling."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","Cross-docking involves receiving goods, inspecting and sorting them, transferring them to shipping areas, and loading them onto outbound trucks for delivery, all while minimising storage time."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","Efficient cross-docking relies on precise coordination with suppliers, customers, and carriers, an advanced inventory management system, well-trained staff, suitable infrastructure, and real-time tracking technology. Effective communication among all parties is also crucial for synchronisation, minimising lead times, and reducing errors."
cross-docking/,"paragraph","The origin of the cross-docking method dates back to the 1930s with the US freight forwarding company United Parcel Service (UPS). UPS implemented this method to optimise the delivery of packages, reducing the time and costs associated with intermediate storage. The term “cross-docking” became popular in the 1980s and 1990s, when large retailers such as Walmart adopted this technique to improve the efficiency of their supply chain."

purchasing-department/,"paragraph","“A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.”"
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","This is a statement often used in the supply chain sector, which is very true, even if somewhat cliché. If we think of the supply chain in an extremely simplified way, it would be made up of three elements: our supplier, our company and the customer."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","The reality, however, is infinitely more complex. Our suppliers can number tens or even hundreds and in turn are also dependent on their  suppliers , not to mention the fact that very often there are logistics service companies acting as intermediaries."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","All the steps that take place before the product arrives at our company (known as upstream management) will be the responsibility of the purchasing department, which in turn will define the  purchasing strategy ."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","Purchasing plays a very important role in the activity of a company, especially if we take into account its weight in the accounts of most organisations."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","On average – although taking into account that each case is different – purchasing is considered to account for 60% of the total sales volume in companies. This means that any improvement in purchasing efficiency has a direct impact on margin and thus  profitability ."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","The purchasing department is responsible for managing large volumes of expenditure and investment, which directly affects operating costs. Reducing procurement costs not only improves margins, but can also  free up capital  that can be reinvested in other strategic areas such as research and development, market expansion, or equipment and technology improvements."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","Beyond trying to reduce costs, the role of the procurement department has evolved from a purely administrative function to one with a strategic component. Today, procurement professionals not only focus on getting better prices and procurement conditions but also play a key role in innovation,  sustainability  and risk management."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","This evolution has been made possible by a more analytical approach and the adoption of advanced technologies that enable better decision-making."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","For purchasing to contribute effectively to business success, it must be aligned with corporate strategy. This implies that purchasing decisions should be linked to the company’s overall objectives, such as entering new markets, improving product quality, and establishing improved service levels or sustainability goals."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","Value creation in procurement goes beyond simple cost reduction. It involves innovation, quality management, supplier development and  supply chain optimisation  to generate a positive impact on the business in the long term."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","Innovation is key to creating value. Purchasing can drive innovation by working closely with suppliers to develop new products, improve existing products or implement processes that are more efficient. This collaboration can result in items with better margins, more efficient processes and higher customer satisfaction."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","Maintaining high-quality standards is essential to the success of any business. In purchasing, quality management involves selecting suppliers that meet established standards, implementing quality controls in the procurement process, and continuously monitoring the  performance of the supplier  and its products."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","Supplier development  is a strategy that focuses on improving the capacity and efficiency of existing suppliers. This may involve training, investment in technology, or even strategic alliances that strengthen the relationship and improve the competitiveness of both partners."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","Supplier development not only helps to ensure quality and supply but can also open up opportunities for joint innovation and access to new markets."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","Supply chain optimisation  is another area where procurement can create significant value. This includes efficient inventory management, reducing lead times and improving coordination between the different actors in the chain. An optimised supply chain can reduce costs, improve customer satisfaction, and increase supply chain resilience."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","The evolution of a procurement department’s roadmap reflects a process of maturity and sophistication from a passive and reactive stance to a strategic and proactive force within the organisation."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","This path unfolds in five main phases, each characterised by a significant change in the way purchasing and supplier relations are managed:"

purchasing-department/,"paragraph","The purchasing department is little more than a decentralised and unorganised activity:"
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","At this early stage, the purchasing strategy is practically non-existent. The internal needs of the company are not clear and the supplier market is completely unknown. There is no strategic approach to managing purchasing."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","There is no formal purchasing department. Instead, all employees are in charge of the procurement of their required goods without any specific training, buying what they need without coordination or centralised support."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","There is no grouping of purchasing volumes or standardised processes. The company has no  indicators or performance  measurement system in purchasing, which leads to a lack of control and very low optimisation."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","As for the suppliers, they are the ones who manage the relationship. There are no formal contracts, only orders and invoices and no supplier panel management. The company simply pays for the products without further consideration."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","Communication is non-existent at this stage. There is no internal or external coordination, reflecting the lack of integration and management in the procurement area."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","This is where the purchasing department starts to take shape and the first formal processes are established:"
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","The strategy is based on day-to-day departmental action, although it remains informal. Internal needs are better understood, but knowledge of the supplier market remains limited."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","A purchasing department is defined, although it is at the most basic level. Skills are mainly focused on transaction management, such as dealing with orders and invoices. Management is collective and there is no focus on individual development."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","Processes begin to take shape. Orders, invoices and claims are managed, and basic policies and processes are implemented. Procurement systems and tools are used, marking a significant step forward."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","Supplier relationships are more formal, with a defined supplier panel. Purchasing initiates relationships and begins to evaluate key suppliers, although the relationship remains simple."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","Communication improves within the department, with a focus on measuring transactions. However, it remains internal and does not extend to other stakeholders."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","The purchasing department takes a step forward, adopting a more strategic and market-oriented approach:"
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","The strategy is formalised and centralised in the purchasing department. Internal needs are well known and the supplier market is better understood, allowing for more proactive management."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","The department is organised around specific  categories  and suppliers. Negotiations and framework contracts become more common, and both collective and individual management are strengthened."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","Business practices become more sophisticated. Large RFXs are managed, and the supplier panel is optimised. The department leads productivity actions and starts to manage quality more actively."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","Relations with suppliers become more cooperative. Contracts are formalised and panels are optimised, allowing for a more balanced and collaborative relationship between the company and its suppliers."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","Communication is extended to suppliers and supplier performance is measured, facilitating better decision-making and greater transparency in relationships."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","In this phase, the purchasing department is deeply integrated into the company’s strategy:"
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","Purchasing actively participates in defining the company’s strategy, ensuring that strategic product families are aligned with corporate objectives. The strategy is developed together with top management, which underlines the importance of the department."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","The purchasing department is part of the steering committee, intervening in key decisions. It is managed in conjunction with senior management, and the focus is on value creation through supplier management and innovation capture."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","Business practices are geared towards protecting and optimising the entire supply chain. It involves contracts that protect the company and align strategies with suppliers, encouraging continuous improvement."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","Top management is involved in the selection of strategic suppliers. The relationship with suppliers is based on co-management and collaboration for mutual development and innovation."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","Communication is broadened to include top management, shareholders and other stakeholders. The company’s communication strategy now integrates procurement, reflecting its strategic importance."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","The final phase of the roadmap is where the purchasing department reaches its highest level of integration and maturity:"
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","At this point, purchasing not only supports but also drives the business strategy. Value chains overlap and integrate, enabling full cooperation within and outside of the company."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","The purchasing department is fully integrated into the company’s management and plays an important role in defining and executing corporate strategy. Control is shared with top management, which facilitates agile and effective decision-making."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","Processes  reach their highest level of development. The entire value chain is managed with a focus on continuous improvement and co-management with key suppliers, ensuring that the entire company is aligned in value creation."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","Relations with suppliers are based on strategic collaboration, seeking long-term benefits. Integration with suppliers is total, allowing the company to adapt quickly to market demands while simultaneously fostering innovation."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","Communication extends to all levels, including all relevant stakeholders. Transparency and collaboration are key at this stage, ensuring that all parties are aligned with the company’s objectives."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","As shown in the previous point, managing and collaborating with suppliers is one of the main tasks of procurement teams. The relationship between a company and its supply chain partners progresses through several levels of integration, each with its own approach and methods to improve efficiency and generate value:"
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","<img decoding=""async"" class=""aligncenter  wp-image-2394439"" src=""https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Blog-Supplier-Integration.webp"" alt=""levels of supplier integration"" width=""865"" height=""1060"" srcset=""https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Blog-Supplier-Integration.webp 1081w, https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Blog-Supplier-Integration-245x300.webp 245w, https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Blog-Supplier-Integration-835x1024.webp 835w, https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Blog-Supplier-Integration-768x941.webp 768w, https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Blog-Supplier-Integration-196x240.webp 196w"" sizes=""(max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px"">"
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","At this level, there is no significant coordination with suppliers. Purchasing is focused on basic transaction execution, and buyers operate tactically and locally. The priority is to procure products at the lowest cost without considering optimisations or long-term partnerships."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","Here, the focus becomes more internal, with an emphasis on process integration. Activities include price negotiation, volume consolidation, and supplier rationalisation. Strategic buyers begin to lead processes, improving internal efficiency and reducing costs."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","At this level, the company focuses on productivity through process management, quality optimisation and total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis. Demand management is also introduced, seeking to optimise quantities and reduce waste, which allows for better resource management."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","The focus broadens and collaboration with suppliers on product re-specification and innovation begins, seeking not only to buy better but also to improve productivity and sales."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","At the most advanced level, integration with suppliers focuses on value creation through co-innovation and collaborative design. The company and its suppliers work together to generate products and services that offer superior value, driving competitiveness and innovation in the marketplace."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","The purchasing department works in close cooperation with suppliers, hence the success of the purchasing strategy depends to a large extent on the performance of these ‘partners’ in the supply chain. This is why it is important to monitor the performance of our partners."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","So how can we measure the value of a supplier? We propose that you ask yourself the following questions:"
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","It is important to understand how significant the spending with one supplier is compared to the category total. A high percentage could indicate a key relationship, which merits more strategic management."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","Assess whether the supplier offers opportunities to reduce costs or improve productivity. This may include better prices, more flexible payment terms or innovations that optimise the production process."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","Consider whether the supplier contributes significantly to the differentiation of the final product that reaches the customer, thus enhancing the customer’s perception of value, which is a strategic asset."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","Suppliers that introduce new technologies or innovations can offer a significant competitive advantage, keeping the company at the forefront of the market."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","Analyse the potential impact of a supply failure. If an outage could seriously affect customer satisfaction, this supplier should be managed with special attention."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","Finally, consider the overall impact of the supplier on the category. A supplier that has a high impact in several key areas is critical to the success of the company and should be treated as such."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","As shown in this article, the purchasing department has evolved from a merely operational function to become a strategic role player within organisations. The great weight of procurement in company budgets makes the purchasing department a fundamental link in terms of cost adjustment. It even plays a determining role in innovation in companies through collaboration with suppliers and customers."
purchasing-department/,"paragraph","At the same time, the effectiveness of the supply chain also relies on a well-oiled purchasing process and close cooperation with the other links in the supply chain. Therefore, the efficiency of an organisation’s supply chain and its ability to generate added value depends to a large extent on the well-oiled functioning of the purchasing department."

logistics-networks/,"paragraph","In a business environment marked by uncertainty, supply chain efficiency is more important than ever. A key factor in achieving this efficiency is the design and optimisation of distribution networks. These networks allow companies to manage the flow of products from both factories and from suppliers to the end consumer. Having the correct logistics network design in place can make the difference between an efficient operation and one that incurs excessive storage and/or distribution costs."
logistics-networks/,"paragraph","In this article, we will explore how companies can optimise their distribution networks, focusing on the aspects that have the greatest impact on inventory management. From warehouse configuration to the use of advanced technologies, we will look at how a well-designed network can make a significant contribution to improving a company’s financial and operational performance."
logistics-networks/,"paragraph","A logistics network is the set of facilities, means of transport and processes that allow products to flow from the supplier to the final consumer. This network includes factories, distribution centres, warehouses and shops, all interconnected by logistics routes. In addition, the network also manages critical aspects such as transport, handling and storage of products."
logistics-networks/,"paragraph","The efficient and smooth design of a logistics network is paramount when it comes to minimising costs and maximising product availability. Poor planning can lead to increased warehousing costs and excess inventory or stock-outs that directly affect customer satisfaction."
logistics-networks/,"paragraph","Warehouses are at the heart of any logistics network. Their main function is to coordinate imbalances between supply and demand. The key role of a warehouse is as follows:"
logistics-networks/,"paragraph","According to the main functions they perform, we can distinguish between different types of warehouses:"
logistics-networks/,"paragraph","Factories are the point of origin of most products. When planning logistics networks, it is important to consider how products are managed in the factory. There are several  production models , each with different logistics implications:"
logistics-networks/,"paragraph","Distribution centres (DC) are facilities where inventory is stored before being shipped to retail outlets or end customers. The DC’s location is critical to optimise delivery times and reduce transportation costs. An effective distribution network design may involve having one or more distribution centres, depending on geography and demand."
logistics-networks/,"paragraph","Retail outlets can be physical or digital. In physical shops, it is essential to have an adequate level of inventory to avoid  stock-outs , but without incurring excessive costs. In e-commerce, speed of delivery has become a key competitive differentiator, requiring precise planning of distribution from logistics centres or from shops to the end customer."
logistics-networks/,"paragraph","Transport plays a critical role in every distribution network. Optimising routes and selecting the most appropriate modes of transport (truck, plane, rail, and ship) is essential to reduce costs and ensure fast delivery. In some cases, companies may choose to outsource these services to logistics operators."

logistics-networks/,"paragraph","The first step in optimising a distribution network is to design it correctly. This involves selecting the geographical location of the warehouse, plant and distribution centres, allocating products to the various facilities and mapping out the most efficient logistics routes. This process must take into account both current  demand  and future growth forecasts."

logistics-networks/,"paragraph","Key decisions in the configuration of the logistics network"
logistics-networks/,"paragraph","One of the main objectives of a distribution network is to find the optimal balance between having sufficient inventory to meet demand and minimising the costs associated with warehousing and  stock management . To do this, it is essential to accurately calculate  safety stock  levels. This is the extra amount of inventory held to cover unforeseen demand or supply chain problems."
logistics-networks/,"paragraph","Strategies to reduce inventory costs:"
logistics-networks/,"paragraph","Sometimes the outsourcing of part of the logistics operation to a specialised operator can be cost-effective. Logistics operators can offer economies of scale, allowing companies to minimise costs and improve  service levels . However, it is important to carefully assess the implications of outsourcing these key functions, as there may be a loss of control over some aspects of the operation."
logistics-networks/,"paragraph","The use of advanced technologies is essential to optimise distribution networks. Today, companies can rely on a wide range of tools that improve operational efficiency and decision-making accuracy:"
logistics-networks/,"paragraph","The rise of e-commerce has changed customer expectations in terms of delivery times and flexibility in shipping options. To meet these new demands, many companies are adopting concepts such as urban hubs and dark stores:"
logistics-networks/,"paragraph","Optimising a distribution network has a direct impact on a company’s operational efficiency and profitability. Here are some of the main benefits that can be achieved:"
logistics-networks/,"paragraph","The optimal design of the distribution network reduces transport and warehousing costs. By minimising distances between distribution centres and retail outlets or end customers, companies can reduce shipping costs. In addition, inventory consolidation can reduce the costs associated with warehousing and handling of products."
logistics-networks/,"paragraph","A well-designed network ensures that products are available when and where customers need them. This not only improves customer satisfaction, but also helps companies compete in increasingly demanding markets."
logistics-networks/,"paragraph","An optimised distribution network also provides greater flexibility to adapt to changes in demand. This is especially important in volatile markets, where fluctuations in demand can affect product availability."
logistics-networks/,"paragraph","By reducing unnecessary journeys and optimising logistics routes, companies can also reduce the  environmental impact of their Supply Chain . Sustainability is increasingly important to both consumers and businesses, so optimising the distribution network can have a positive impact on a company’s carbon footprint and therefore its reputation."
logistics-networks/,"paragraph","We have looked at how to realise the benefits of distribution network design and optimisation. Investing in an efficient distribution network not only reduces costs and improves service, but also provides a long-term competitive advantage."
logistics-networks/,"paragraph","Most importantly, this is not a process to do once and forget about, it is not a static process; it requires continuous planning to adapt to changes in demand, technologies and market conditions."
logistics-networks/,"paragraph","Companies that take a strategic approach to the design of their logistics networks and take advantage of advanced technologies can significantly improve their operational efficiency, offering a better service to their customers while reducing operational costs and environmental impact."

logistics-networks/,"paragraph","Proper design of a logistics network minimizes costs, improves product availability, and ensures efficient management of storage, transport, and distribution. A well-designed network reduces excess inventory and shipping costs, while poor planning can lead to stock-outs or costly warehousing."
logistics-networks/,"paragraph","Although the two terms are often used interchangeably, there is a key difference: a warehouse is usually focused on long-term storage of products, while a distribution centre is designed for a faster flow of products, with the aim of distributing them to shops or customers in the shortest possible time. In addition, distribution centres often perform other tasks such as product consolidation or order picking."
logistics-networks/,"paragraph","Cross-docking is a logistics technique in which products arriving at a warehouse or distribution centre are not stored, but transferred directly to delivery vehicles for distribution. This method significantly reduces warehousing times and associated costs, as products spend less time in inventory. It also allows for a faster response to demand and improves efficiency in the delivery of goods."
logistics-networks/,"paragraph","A warehouse management system (WMS) is software that controls and optimises operations within a warehouse. Its functionalities include managing inventory, monitoring the flow of goods, allocating storage space and optimising picking and packing. A WMS improves operational efficiency, reduces errors in inventory management and increases accuracy in order picking, which translates into better customer service and lower operating costs."
logistics-networks/,"paragraph","Economies of scale occur when a company reduces unit costs by increasing the volume of production or distribution. In a distribution network, this may mean consolidating inventories in fewer large warehouses or using logistics resources, such as transportation and warehousing, more efficiently. By managing larger volumes of products centrally, companies can reduce unit costs, which improves operational profitability."

days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","Aurea mediocritas. That is, the “golden mean” or rather the middle ground between two extremes."
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","In the realm of  inventory management , aurea mediocritas embodies the ideal equilibrium between avoiding excessive stock accumulation, which risks obsolescence and ties up capital, and preventing recurrent stockouts, which can result in lost sales and customer dissatisfaction. Attaining this delicate balance is the ultimate objective for any competitive organization."
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","To reach this balance point, supply chain professionals use various  KPIs  to monitor the state of inventory in order to avoid excesses and shortages. Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) is an invaluable tool in the endeavour."
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","Days in inventory is a simple formula that measures the average number of days of stock you have."
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","Naturally, the lower this number is, the faster you will be able to get products out of stock. Therefore, you will be more productive and efficient."
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","The way to calculate the days in stock formula is as follows:"
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","<img decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone wp-image-1954516"" src=""https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/days-of-inventory-formula.png"" alt="""" width=""977"" height=""329"" srcset=""https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/days-of-inventory-formula.png 1190w, https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/days-of-inventory-formula-300x101.png 300w, https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/days-of-inventory-formula-1024x345.png 1024w, https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/days-of-inventory-formula-768x259.png 768w, https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/days-of-inventory-formula-400x135.png 400w"" sizes=""(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px"">"
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","In the formula we distinguish two concepts:"
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","By dividing the average inventory by the  cost of goods  sold and multiplying it by the period we want to analyse (usually one year), we obtain the average number of days it takes for a company’s inventory to be sold."
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","If we want to talk about working days, we would multiply by 52*5 = 260 days instead of 365 days."

days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","This gives us a measure of how efficiently the company is managing its inventory."
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","Imagine you are an appliance dealer and you want to calculate the DIO for different brands of refrigerators. Well, to start with, we should establish the time period we want to calculate for the inventory days (as mentioned above, it is usually a year) and collect the following data: the average annual inventory and the cost of goods sold."
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","In order to determine the DIO of each brand, we would carry out the following operations:"
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","To determine the DIO of each brand:"
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","DIO Brand 1 : ($3,000 / $35,000) * 265 = 31.29"
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","DIO Brand 2 : ($1,000 / $40,000) * 365 = 9.13"
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","DIO Brand 3 : ($5,000 / $54,000) * 365 = 33.80"
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","DIO Brand 4 : ($1,500 / $20,000) * 365  = 27.38"
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","As mentioned above, Days Inventory Outstanding is a KPI. Specifically, this performance indicator is used to measure the number of days that, on average, a company keeps a product in stock – be it a raw material, component or final item – before it is sold."
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","On the one hand, Days Inventory Outstanding helps companies assess the efficiency of their  inventory management  by measuring how long inventory remains in the warehouse before it is sold. This allows companies to identify opportunities to optimise their inventory processes, such as reducing excess stock or improving  turnover ."
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","Similarly, by calculating the average time inventory remains in the warehouse before it is converted into sales, DIO provides information on how long  capital  is “tied up” in products. A lower DIO indicates that capital is converted more quickly into sales, which can improve the company’s cash flow."
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","A lower DIO also means there is less time for inventory to become obsolete or unsaleable. By monitoring DIO, companies can proactively identify and address the risk of obsolescence, which helps reduce losses associated with obsolete products."
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","To interpret Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO), it is necessary to understand how it relates to a company’s operational and financial efficiency. Obviously, what we mean by “high DIO” or “low DIO” will depend on the company and the industry. However, let us see how a general interpretation of this KPI could be carried out."
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","A low DIO is generally considered favourable. It indicates that the company is selling its inventory quickly, which can be a sign of efficient stock management and high demand for its products. This can result in better liquidity, as the company converts its inventory into cash more quickly. However, an extremely low DIO can also indicate a worryingly low level of inventory, which could result in order fulfilment problems if  demand  increases unexpectedly or if there are disruptions in the supply chain."
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","A high DIO can be problematic as it suggests that the company is taking longer to sell its inventory. This can indicate a number of problems, such as overstocking, product obsolescence, low demand, or  supply chain management  issues. A high DIO can negatively affect a company’s profitability, as the costs associated with warehousing and holding inventory can increase. In addition, a high DIO may also be indicative of improved operational efficiency and reduced liquidity."
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) can vary significantly between different sectors due to differences in the nature of products, product lifecycles, business models, and industry practices."
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","For reference, here are some examples of sectors with very different DIOs:"
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","In this sector, where products have a high turnover and constant demand, a low DIO would be the most common. Products such as food, beverages, and personal care items tend to have short  lifecycles  and predictable demand, leading to a lower DIO."
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","In this sector, where products are bulky, expensive, have less predictable demand, and usually a long  lead time , high DIO is common. Construction materials can remain in inventory for extended periods due to the seasonal nature of construction and long-term projects."
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","In fashion, products often have short lifecycles due to changing trends and often have higher prices. DIO can vary according to the season and demand for specific products. Some fast fashion products may have a low DIO, while luxury items may have a higher DIO due to exclusivity and lower turnover."
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","Stock turnover and Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) are two metrics related to inventory management, but have slightly different approaches. Interpreting the two provides complementary insights into a company’s operational efficiency."
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","As we have already extensively reviewed what DIO is, let us look in a little more detail at what stock rotation is in the context of inventory management."
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","Stock turnover is also a measure of how quickly a company sells and replaces its inventory in a given period of time, usually a year. It is calculated by dividing the cost of goods sold (COGS) by the average inventory over the same period. The basic formula is:"
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","<img decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-1954765"" src=""https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/stock-turnover-ratio.png"" alt="""" width=""1169"" height=""453"" srcset=""https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/stock-turnover-ratio.png 1169w, https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/stock-turnover-ratio-300x116.png 300w, https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/stock-turnover-ratio-1024x397.png 1024w, https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/stock-turnover-ratio-768x298.png 768w, https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/stock-turnover-ratio-400x155.png 400w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1169px) 100vw, 1169px"">"
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","Stock turnover  indicates how many times inventory has been sold and replaced during the specified period. A high stock turnover is generally considered favourable, as it suggests that the company is selling its inventory quickly and replenishing it effectively."
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","Therefore, the main difference between the two metrics lies in their temporal focus: stock rotation focuses on the number of times inventory is sold and replaced in a year, while DIO focuses on how long it takes for inventory to be sold in terms of days."
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","Finding the “golden mean” or the “virtue of the middle ground” in stock management is of great importance for business competitiveness. Maintaining a balance between  excess  and  shortage  of inventory is key to avoid risks of obsolescence and lost sales."
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","KPIs such as Days Inventory Outstanding allow businesses to continuously monitor and adjust inventory to ensure efficient operation and customer satisfaction. In this delicate balance lies the true virtue of successful stock management."
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","<img decoding=""async"" id=""hs-cta-img-dc20530a-17ab-40ed-a64c-7285135483ec"" class=""hs-cta-img"" style=""border-width: 0px;"" src=""https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/7651234/dc20530a-17ab-40ed-a64c-7285135483ec.png"" alt=""New call-to-action"">  hbspt.cta.load(7651234, 'dc20530a-17ab-40ed-a64c-7285135483ec', {""useNewLoader"":""true"",""region"":""na1""});"
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","DIO should be implemented through regular monitoring of inventory and cost of goods sold, identifying significant trends and variations. Companies should set specific DIO objectives based on the characteristics of their industry and business model, and then implement measures to optimise inventory, improve operational and financial efficiency, and ensure proper cash flow management to maintain a competitive market position."
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","In addition to DIO, other KPIs to measure the efficiency of stock management include the inventory turnover rate, which assesses how many times inventory is sold and replaced in a given period, and the OTIF, which measures the company’s ability to meet customer demand in a timely and complete manner. The obsolescence rate is also a common indicator when measuring the efficiency of inventory management."
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","A Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) that is too high can lead to obsolescence problems, excess inventory and low liquidity, affecting profitability and operational efficiency. On the other hand, a DIO that is too low can lead to inventory shortages, lost sales and loss of customer satisfaction due to the inability to meet customer demand, which can also negatively affect the company’s profitability and reputation."
days-inventory-outstanding/,"paragraph","Determining the right DIO for a specific business benchmark involves considering a number of factors, such as industry, product life cycle, product lead times, market demand, and business objectives. A detailed analysis of these elements, as well as comparisons with similar companies within the industry, is essential to establish a target DIO that ensures efficient inventory management and meets the operational and financial needs of the company."

sustainable-supply-chain-practices-in-the-food-and-beverage-industry/,"paragraph","Managing a food supply chain requires navigating numerous challenges, including high-cost pressure, increasing demand for traceability, and ensuring the  resilience of the supply chain . But perhaps most crucially today, making sure  sustainability  is managed effectively."
sustainable-supply-chain-practices-in-the-food-and-beverage-industry/,"paragraph","Researchers from the International Energy Agency (2018) stated that around 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from freight transportation, and when emissions from warehouses and ports are included, this number increases to 11%. For the food and beverage industries, the logistics footprint is even bigger  as 14% of inventory is lost before it reaches the retailer (FAO, 2019)."
sustainable-supply-chain-practices-in-the-food-and-beverage-industry/,"paragraph","These astonishing numbers illustrate the importance of adopting  sustainable supply chain  practices in the food and beverage industry. The importance of ESG initiatives in the supply chain is underscored by a McKinsey & Company survey (2020), which found that 7 out of the 9 most common ESG initiatives directly involve or significantly impact the supply chain."
sustainable-supply-chain-practices-in-the-food-and-beverage-industry/,"paragraph","Not only do companies see the need for a change towards more sustainable practices, but consumers are increasingly expressing their need for sustainable products. The Food Industry Association (2023) states that more than 30% of shoppers say that sustainability efforts and practices are among the most important attributes in their choice of a store."
sustainable-supply-chain-practices-in-the-food-and-beverage-industry/,"paragraph","This same study has shown that the younger generations like Gen Z and Millennials are willing to back this up with their wallet. Specifically, 48% of Gen Z and 59% of Millennials are prepared to pay more for environmental-friendly products. Therefore, integrating sustainability into your supply chain is essential for maintaining a competitive edge that is future-proof."
sustainable-supply-chain-practices-in-the-food-and-beverage-industry/,"paragraph","For decades, companies have worked to optimise their supply chain in which the trade-off between operational costs and delivering service to their customers was key. This has led to a complex supply chain landscape of today: going from next day to same-day or even 15 minutes same day deliveries."
sustainable-supply-chain-practices-in-the-food-and-beverage-industry/,"paragraph","To satisfy the ever-growing needs of the customer, the assortments have kept on expanding, leading to a complicated catalogue. And now this extra factor, sustainability, has been added. So, change is needed, and you would like to be part of the solution, not the problem. But how?"
sustainable-supply-chain-practices-in-the-food-and-beverage-industry/,"paragraph","Luckily,  technology  has developed a lot over the last years as well and can help to transform these traditional supply chains. An example of what this new technology can provide you is data-driven forecasts that are generated automatically."
sustainable-supply-chain-practices-in-the-food-and-beverage-industry/,"paragraph","This will enable the demand planning department to predict  demand  more accurately, resulting in a reduced chance of  overstocking  and it will become less likely that products meet their shelf life in your warehouse."
sustainable-supply-chain-practices-in-the-food-and-beverage-industry/,"paragraph","As previously mentioned, waste is a critical factor to consider. While maintaining a high  service level  is essential, why not also use the maximum/remaining shelf life as part of an automated inventory management system?"
sustainable-supply-chain-practices-in-the-food-and-beverage-industry/,"paragraph","By integrating sustainability objectives into  inventory management , companies can balance the need for  availability  with the incentive to minimize waste. This dual focus not only optimizes  costs  but also aligns with environmental goals and consumer expectations for sustainable practices."
sustainable-supply-chain-practices-in-the-food-and-beverage-industry/,"paragraph","Another way to live up to the objective of acting more sustainably is by creating an  ABC analysis . This analysis is often done in inventory management to focus on articles which either serve many of your customers or articles that generate most of your revenue, but another dimension could be added: the  carbon footprint  of an article."
sustainable-supply-chain-practices-in-the-food-and-beverage-industry/,"paragraph","A-items would be more sustainable than your C-items and you could adjust your service levels accordingly. For example, you could differentiate service levels to minimise the impact of waste for products with a large carbon footprint."
sustainable-supply-chain-practices-in-the-food-and-beverage-industry/,"paragraph","This will not only decrease waste in your supply chain but this categorization can also help to gain consciousness on the carbon footprint of your assortment."
sustainable-supply-chain-practices-in-the-food-and-beverage-industry/,"paragraph","Sustainability is no longer merely a trend; it is a fundamental expectation from the  consumer . And something that the food and beverage industry must address. To be able to meet this expectation,traditional supply chain practices need to be reviewed."
sustainable-supply-chain-practices-in-the-food-and-beverage-industry/,"paragraph","By optimizing  transportation , sourcing locally and  minimizing waste , companies can reduce their  carbon footprint . By embracing technology, business can create the capabilities to achieve sustainability goals while maintaining operational excellence."
sustainable-supply-chain-practices-in-the-food-and-beverage-industry/,"paragraph","Sustainability  as an extra objective brings additional challenges to the ever-so-complicated food supply chain. But it does not have to be as complicated as it seems, with the right tools these challenges can still be effectively managed."
sustainable-supply-chain-practices-in-the-food-and-beverage-industry/,"paragraph","Sustainability is crucial in the food supply chain because it helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, minimizes waste, and meets consumer demand for environmentally friendly products. Sustainable practices ensure the long-term viability of supply chains and align with consumer expectations."
sustainable-supply-chain-practices-in-the-food-and-beverage-industry/,"paragraph","Freight transportation contributes to approximately 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. When emissions from warehouses and ports are included, this number rises to 11%. In the food and beverage industry, a significant portion of inventory is lost before reaching the retailer, further emphasizing the need for sustainable practices."
sustainable-supply-chain-practices-in-the-food-and-beverage-industry/,"paragraph","Consumer expectations play a significant role as more shoppers prioritize sustainability efforts in their choice of stores. Younger generations, such as Gen Z and Millennials, are willing to pay more for environmentally friendly products, pushing companies to integrate sustainable practices to remain competitive."
sustainable-supply-chain-practices-in-the-food-and-beverage-industry/,"paragraph","Technology can provide data-driven forecasts, enabling accurate demand prediction and reducing overstocking. Automated inventory management systems can integrate sustainability objectives, helping to balance availability with waste minimization. Additionally, technology can facilitate ABC analysis to focus on products with lower carbon footprints."
sustainable-supply-chain-practices-in-the-food-and-beverage-industry/,"paragraph","Strategies to optimize sustainability include optimizing transportation, sourcing locally, minimizing waste, and using technology for accurate demand planning and inventory management. Implementing ABC analysis to categorize products based on their carbon footprint can help adjust service levels and reduce waste, ultimately aligning supply chain operations with sustainability goals."

pharmaceutical-supply-chain-management-in-the-mea-region/,"paragraph","Pharmaceutical companies play a crucial role in ensuring that life-saving medicines reach the people who need them most. Therefore, a reliable supply chain is essential to maintain the trust of customers and ensure the consistent availability of critical medications."
pharmaceutical-supply-chain-management-in-the-mea-region/,"paragraph","However,  pharmaceutical supply chain management  comes with significant challenges, as the industry operates in a highly regulated and complex environment. A well-managed pharmaceutic supply chain ensures that the right product reaches the right patient, in the right condition, at the right time."
pharmaceutical-supply-chain-management-in-the-mea-region/,"paragraph","To better understand the complexities of supply chain management in the pharmaceutical industry, it is essential to explore the unique characteristics of a pharma company’s product assortment."
pharmaceutical-supply-chain-management-in-the-mea-region/,"paragraph","Every medicine will have an Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API), which is the central component of the medicine that produces the required effect on the body to treat a condition."
pharmaceutical-supply-chain-management-in-the-mea-region/,"paragraph","A single API can be formulated into multiple products, leading to different items within a company’s portfolio that treat the same condition. For some patients or distribution channels, these products may be interchangeable. However, substitution isn’t always possible due to factors such as patient needs, regulatory restrictions, or insurance coverage."
pharmaceutical-supply-chain-management-in-the-mea-region/,"paragraph","As a result, pharmaceutical companies must establish precise business rules to manage substitutions and ensure compliance with legal and safety standards. Setting up these rules correctly is critical, not just for operational efficiency, but for patient safety."
pharmaceutical-supply-chain-management-in-the-mea-region/,"paragraph","Another challenge pharma companies face is the division between prescription drugs and over-the-counter (OTC) products in their assortment."
pharmaceutical-supply-chain-management-in-the-mea-region/,"paragraph","In the MEA region, insurance companies typically operate using  formularies , which are lists of drugs that are covered or reimbursed based on cost-effectiveness assessments. These formularies play a crucial role in determining which medications are accessible to insured patients, directly influencing prescription and utilization patterns. If a drug is not included on a formulary, its demand may drop significantly as patients and healthcare providers often opt for alternative treatments that are covered."
pharmaceutical-supply-chain-management-in-the-mea-region/,"paragraph","Incorporating the formularies of the region’s largest insurance providers into  demand planning  can greatly enhance forecast accuracy and market responsiveness. When a medication is added to or removed from a formulary, it can trigger significant shifts in demand, impacting not only sales but also inventory management."
pharmaceutical-supply-chain-management-in-the-mea-region/,"paragraph","As such, regular monitoring of these formulary changes and adjusting sales forecasts accordingly is essential for optimizing inventory, avoiding overstock or shortages, and ensuring supply meets the actual market needs. By aligning forecasts with formulary updates, companies can better manage their distribution strategies and maintain a competitive edge."
pharmaceutical-supply-chain-management-in-the-mea-region/,"paragraph","The diverse assortment of pharmaceutical products necessitates a strategic segmentation approach, allowing companies to establish target service levels tailored to the unique characteristics of each product."
pharmaceutical-supply-chain-management-in-the-mea-region/,"paragraph","This segmentation can be mapped across two axes: demand volatility and sales value. By categorizing products accordingly, companies can prioritize their planning efforts and effectively  manage service levels ."

pharmaceutical-supply-chain-management-in-the-mea-region/,"paragraph","By implementing strategic segmentation based on demand volatility and sales value, pharmaceutical companies can enhance inventory management, forecast accuracy. This approach enables teams to prioritize their efforts on items that genuinely require attention, ensuring that critical medications are consistently available when patients need them most."

cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","A topic we regularly discuss on our blog is the different  KPIs  that we can use to measure the effectiveness of operations and inventory management. This relationship between financial performance and operations gives us an idea of a company’s level of efficiency."
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","In this article, we will take a closer look at the CCC (Cash Conversion Cycle). It’s a relatively complex KPI because to calculate it, we first need to calculate 3 other KPIs (DIO, DSO and DPO). Let’s take a look at all of them below."
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","The Cash Conversion Cyle is a metric that measures the time it takes from when a company makes a payment to purchase inventory until it receives disbursement from the customer for the sale of that inventory."
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","In other words, it represents the period during which a company’s capital is committed in the operating cycle. It comprises three main stages: the inventory period, during which the company acquires and stores inventory; the accounts receivable period, in which inventory is sold to customers on credit; and the accounts payable period, which represents the time the company has to pay its suppliers."
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","For practical purposes, the CCC – or rather its interpretation and consequent decision-making – can help us in the following aspects of running a business:"
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","It helps to assess how efficiently a company manages its operating  cash flow . A shorter CCC means that the company recovers its investment more quickly, improving its liquidity."
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","It allows the company to identify inefficiencies in the  management of inventory , accounts receivable, and accounts payable. By understanding these components, the company can take steps to reduce the amount of time that  capital  is committed in the operating cycle."
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","It provides a metric to compare the company’s operating performance over time and against its competitors. A lower CCC generally indicates better operating efficiency."
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","It assists in strategic  planning  and decision-making. Companies can use the CCC to adjust their financing strategies and improve inventory and credit management practices."
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","It can reveal underlying problems in the supply chain, production, inventory management, or accounts receivable. In turn, this allows the company to take action to correct the situation if necessary."
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","As mentioned, the complexity of the Cash Conversion Cycle lies in the fact that, in order to calculate it, we must first determine the value of other KPIs. So, to calculate the CCC, we must first know the DIO (Days of Inventory Outstanding), the DSO (Days Sales Outstanding) and the DPO (Days Payable Outstanding). In a nutshell, this is what these 3 KPIs measure:"
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","Once these values have been determined, the formula used to determine the CCC is as follows:"
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","CCC =DIO+DSO-DPO"
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","Now we know the formula, let’s go through a practical example. Let’s think about a lamp manufacturer that wants to measure the CCC of four of its references. Well, the first thing it should do is to find out the 3 KPIs we have seen before: the DIO, the DSO, and the DPO."
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","Once this data has been collected, we are in a position to calculate the CCC."
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","1. Lamp A"
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","CCC 𝐴=45+30-20=55 days"
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","2. Lamp B"
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","CCC 𝐵=50+35-25=60 days"
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","3. Lamp C"
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","CCC𝐶=40+25-30=35 days"
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","4. Lamp D"
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","CCC𝐷=60+40-35=65 days"
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","Results"
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","ReferenceCCC (Days)"
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","We can mainly draw conclusions from the CCC based on whether the value we obtain is high or low. However, what is considered a high CCC or a low CCC will depend on the sector in which the company operates, the nature of its own business, the macroeconomic context, etc."
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","That said, here are some of the main generic interpretations that we can make of this KPI:"
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","In our previous example, that of the lamp manufacturer, the interpretation we could make of the CCC is as follows:"
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","The level at which we decide to calculate the CCC will depend on the specific needs of the company, as well as the level of detail we want. Depending on a person’s role in the company, the level of detail that is required will be different."
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","As mentioned above, although it is not the only influential variable, the sector of activity largely determines what is considered a high or low Cash Conversion Cycle. Let’s look at some examples."
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","The cash conversion cycle is generally very low, especially for perishable products. Companies need to quickly convert inventory into sales to avoid losses and avoidable waste."
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","Generally low, as  inventory turnover  is fast and the customer pays as soon as the product is purchased. However, payment terms to suppliers can be extended to optimise cash flow, which can help to maintain a low CCC."
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","Moderate to high, as production processes can be lengthy and the time to convert inventory into sales is longer. In addition, they may offer longer credit terms to their customers. Obviously, there can be large variations depending on the products being manufactured."
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","Variable, depending on the product. Products with high turnover and rapid obsolescence should have a lower CCC."
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","Pre-launch is high due to long development and regulatory approval periods. However, once on the market and with regular demand,  lead times  can decrease and stabilise, as can the CCC."
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","High, as products have long life cycles and demand is less frequent. Production and distribution can also be longer."
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","The Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) is an important metric for measuring and adjusting the financial efficiency of a company. It provides a clear picture of how long it takes a company to convert its inventory investments into cash flows. Therefore, an optimised CCC can improve liquidity and ‘free up’ cash that would otherwise be tied up in stock and at risk of being devalued."
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","Understanding CCC allows for the identification of inefficiencies in inventory management and in supplier and customer relationships, enabling companies to make more informed strategic decisions."
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","But it is also important to bear in mind that the assessment of the CCC should be contextualised according to the specificities of the sector and the nature of the company – a fast fashion company is not the same as a luxury clothing retailer, even if both operate in the fashion sector – in order to set realistic targets."
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","Optimising the Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) can be done in three ways: by improving inventory management, and/or accounts receivable, and/or accounts payable. This can be done by implementing practices such as reducing inventory levels, streamlining the collection process by offering early payment discounts, and using technology to efficiently manage accounts receivable. In addition, negotiating more favourable payment terms with suppliers can extend the accounts payable period."
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","Although a high CCC is often a symptom of low efficiency, it can benefit companies by allowing more flexibility in payment terms to customers, which can strengthen business relationships and increase sales. It can also indicate greater investment in inventory, ensuring product availability and avoiding stock-outs. This can be strategic in sectors where maintaining ample inventories is crucial to meet demand and remain competitive in the marketplace."
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","While a low CCC is often a sign of efficiency, it can also have risks such as insufficient inventory, which affects sales, overly aggressive collection policies that can damage customer relationships, and short supplier payment terms that can affect the stability of the supply chain."
cash-conversion-cycle/,"paragraph","Supply chain costs are soaring all over the world. And like many of your competitors, you’ve probably been thinking about how you’re investing your working capital."

inventory-management/,"paragraph","Inventory management is a business process that directly influences a company’s profitability and competitiveness. The key lies in achieving a balance between having enough stock to meet demand and minimising storage costs and the risk of obsolescence. In this article, we will break down what inventory management entails."
inventory-management/,"paragraph","Inventory management is the process of overseeing and controlling the flow of products within a company, from acquisition to storage and eventual distribution or sale. The aim is to maintain a balance between product availability and inventory costs."
inventory-management/,"paragraph","Effective inventory management allows companies to respond efficiently to market demand without  overstocking , which often leads to financial and operational issues."
inventory-management/,"paragraph","The increasing complexity of supply chains and evolving customer expectations have amplified the challenges in inventory management. Below are three of the most significant challenges faced today."
inventory-management/,"paragraph","The growing cost of warehouse space, along with labour expenses, has increased the overall cost of maintaining larger inventories to ensure high availability."
inventory-management/,"paragraph","With the rapid changes in market trends and technological advancements, keeping large quantities of stock increases the risk of certain products becoming obsolete."
inventory-management/,"paragraph","Accessing credit or financing to cover large inventories can be challenging for some companies, affecting their cash flow. Studies suggest that the value of inventory can represent more than 30% of a company’s assets, highlighting the importance of implementing efficient inventory management processes to reduce financial risks and enhance profitability."
inventory-management/,"paragraph","<img decoding=""async"" id=""hs-cta-img-ff337ec5-9fff-46e0-b104-b57f85ed1625"" class=""hs-cta-img"" style=""border-width: 0px;"" src=""https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/7651234/ff337ec5-9fff-46e0-b104-b57f85ed1625.png"" alt=""New call-to-action"">  hbspt.cta.load(7651234, 'ff337ec5-9fff-46e0-b104-b57f85ed1625', {""useNewLoader"":""true"",""region"":""na1""});"
inventory-management/,"paragraph","The first thing to consider is that effective inventory management begins with clear alignment with the company’s business strategy. Depending on the company’s positioning, inventory management will vary."
inventory-management/,"paragraph","According to Treacy and Wiersema’s model, there are three main strategic approaches:"
inventory-management/,"paragraph","Identifying which of these strategies dominates your company will allow you to better focus your inventory decisions. For instance, if your company specialises in operational excellence, your challenge will be to minimise stock levels, whereas a company excelling in customer intimacy will need to pay special attention to preventing stockouts."
inventory-management/,"paragraph","One of the key tactics in inventory management is the  ABC classification , based on Pareto’s principle, which indicates that 20% of products generate 80% of the revenue."
inventory-management/,"paragraph","This means that the most valuable products for the company should receive greater attention and control, while those with less impact can be managed more simply."
inventory-management/,"paragraph","This approach helps businesses prioritise resources on the most profitable products and avoid wasting time and effort on those that add less value."
inventory-management/,"paragraph","Managing the product assortment is one of the most complex areas of inventory management. Companies must determine which products to keep in stock, when to introduce new ones, and when to phase out those that are no longer profitable. This task is simplified with tools like assortment matrices, which help make more rational, less emotional decisions about product portfolio management."
inventory-management/,"paragraph","Additionally,  controlling the product lifecycle  is essential to prevent stock accumulation that may eventually become obsolete. Most products go through various stages: introduction, growth, maturity, and decline. Stock levels must be adjusted according to the product’s life stage. The greatest risks of obsolescence occur at the beginning and end of the lifecycle, when demand is most uncertain."
inventory-management/,"paragraph","One of the most effective methods for deciding whether to stock a product is using a stock index, like the one shown below:"
inventory-management/,"paragraph","<img decoding=""async"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-2370401 size-full"" title=""example of product lifecycle management (PLM)"" src=""https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/example-of-PLM-product-lifecycle-management.png"" alt=""example of product lifecycle management"" width=""889"" height=""623"" srcset=""https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/example-of-PLM-product-lifecycle-management.png 889w, https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/example-of-PLM-product-lifecycle-management-300x210.png 300w, https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/example-of-PLM-product-lifecycle-management-768x538.png 768w, https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/example-of-PLM-product-lifecycle-management-342x240.png 342w"" sizes=""(max-width: 889px) 100vw, 889px"">"
inventory-management/,"paragraph","Safety stock is an additional reserve of products kept to cover unforeseen circumstances, such as a sudden increase in demand or supplier delivery delays. Deciding when and how much to order is one of the most important decisions in inventory management."
inventory-management/,"paragraph","Safety stock calculation should be based on factors such as:"
inventory-management/,"paragraph","Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) is a mathematical method that helps businesses determine the optimal quantity of products to order. EOQ aims to balance ordering costs with storage costs, minimising overall inventory-related expenses. EOQ is particularly useful because it helps companies reduce total inventory handling costs, ensuring they order the right quantity at the right time, avoiding both overstock and stockouts.   Learn more about EOQ and its formula ."
inventory-management/,"paragraph","As inventory complexity grows and product assortments expand, it is crucial to implement exception management tools. These tools allow you to focus on the most critical products, while less important items can be managed automatically by software."
inventory-management/,"paragraph","Exception management enables inventory teams to dedicate their time and resources to resolving issues that truly impact profitability, leaving automated systems to manage less significant products."
inventory-management/,"paragraph","In inventory management, measuring performance is essential to identify areas for improvement and ensure that inventory operations are efficient and profitable. This performance is measured through KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)."
inventory-management/,"paragraph","Let’s review some of the most important KPIs in inventory management:"
inventory-management/,"paragraph","Inventory turnover  measures how many times total inventory has been sold or used during a given period. A high turnover usually indicates that products sell quickly, while a low turnover can suggest poor management, potentially leading to obsolete products."
inventory-management/,"paragraph","Service level indicates the percentage of orders a company can fulfil from its available inventory without relying on emergency orders. A high service level means the company has the right amount of stock to meet customer demand."
inventory-management/,"paragraph","This KPI reflects the percentage of inventory that becomes obsolete and cannot be sold. A rising obsolescence rate may indicate poor planning or misalignment between stock levels and market demand."
inventory-management/,"paragraph","Lead time  measures the time elapsed from when an order is placed with a supplier to when the products arrive in stock. Reducing this time is crucial to improving operational efficiency and lowering the necessary safety stock."
inventory-management/,"paragraph","Inventory management varies significantly depending on the industry. Each sector has its own challenges and nuances that shape how they manage their inventories."
inventory-management/,"paragraph","Below, we explore how inventory management approaches differ across manufacturing, distribution, retail, and ecommerce."
inventory-management/,"paragraph","Inventory management in manufacturing  focuses primarily on balancing raw material availability with efficient production."
inventory-management/,"paragraph","Key aspects of this sector include:"
inventory-management/,"paragraph","In the distribution sector, the primary challenge is managing large volumes of products that move between different points in the supply chain, from manufacturers to retailers."
inventory-management/,"paragraph","The key aspects of this sector include:"
inventory-management/,"paragraph","The  retail sector  faces inventory management challenges linked to the high turnover of products and the need to meet customer demand immediately."
inventory-management/,"paragraph","The key factors in this sector include:"
inventory-management/,"paragraph","Ultimately, the goal of inventory management is to optimise operations and increase efficiency. This reduces costs associated with storing, ordering, and distributing products. For example, it’s common for companies to maintain order volumes that haven’t been reviewed for years, which can lead to overstocking or stockouts, depending on the timing."
inventory-management/,"paragraph","Implementing an efficient inventory management system offers several benefits for businesses:"
inventory-management/,"paragraph","The challenge is to find the right balance between inventory costs and ordering costs. Redefining order quantities, using methodologies such as Economic Order Quantity (EOQ), can lead to significant savings. Additionally, integrating systems allows for process automation and constant monitoring of costs and stock levels."

corporate-sustainability-reporting-directive/,"paragraph","The  Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)  is a crucial piece of European legislation that requires companies to disclose their sustainability efforts according to standardised definitions. By ensuring transparency in reporting, CSRD allows investors to assess and compare companies’ performance on key Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria."
corporate-sustainability-reporting-directive/,"paragraph","As part of  our commitment to sustainability , Slimstock is preparing to meet CSRD compliance by 2025. In this article series, we aim to explain the directive and share our journey toward becoming fully compliant."
corporate-sustainability-reporting-directive/,"paragraph","The journey towards  CSRD  compliance begins with a landmark global agreement: the  Paris Agreemen t. Signed in 2016, it brought nearly every country on earth together with a shared goal: to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, ideally aiming for 1.5 degrees. To achieve this, greenhouse gas emissions must be significantly reduced, with a target of a 50% reduction by 2030 and  net-zero emissions by 2050 ."
corporate-sustainability-reporting-directive/,"paragraph","Building on this momentum, in 2020 the  European Commission  introduced the  European Green Deal —a comprehensive set of measures designed to make the EU climate neutral by 2050. CSRD is one of the initiatives within this framework, ensuring that businesses disclose a broad array of sustainability metrics."
corporate-sustainability-reporting-directive/,"paragraph","While the directive certainly includes environmental reporting, it goes much further, incorporating  social  and  governance  aspects as well. The main objective is to provide investors with the data needed to consider ESG factors when evaluating companies, enabling more informed decision-making and supporting the transition to a sustainable economy."
corporate-sustainability-reporting-directive/,"paragraph","The CSRD applies to various categories of companies. The main criteria are:"

corporate-sustainability-reporting-directive/,"paragraph","The timeline for compliance varies based on company size and listing status:"
corporate-sustainability-reporting-directive/,"paragraph","To help ease the transition, the first few years will have more relaxed reporting requirements. However, from  2028 , all companies must comply with the full scope of the directive, with no phased-in provisions."
corporate-sustainability-reporting-directive/,"paragraph","Start now —the sooner you begin preparing for CSRD compliance, the smoother the process will be. The first step is to determine which reporting group your company falls into and understand the specific requirements and deadlines."

long-tail-inventory/,"paragraph","In our modern world where the likes of Amazon and Alibaba reign supreme, no one is willing to wait. Thus, to remain competitive, you must be able to offer exactly what your customer needs, exactly when they need it! Consequently, even the most niche of businesses now seem to hold  a long tail encompassing thousands upon thousands of product lines."
long-tail-inventory/,"paragraph","Customers expect choice. Customers expect next (or even same day) delivery. But as a one-stop-shop for all of your customer’s needs, you are probably all too familiar with the pains of managing a massive long tail!"
long-tail-inventory/,"paragraph","The question is: what can you do about it? How can?"
long-tail-inventory/,"paragraph","When you consider that 80% of a business’s turnover is typically generated by just 20% of the assortment, many businesses invest a huge amount of resources into managing literally thousands of items that offer limited value to the business in terms of profit and value to the end customer."
long-tail-inventory/,"paragraph","In this article, I explore how you can squeeze the maximum value from your long tail without compromising your ability to meet the needs of your customers. Let me explain."
long-tail-inventory/,"paragraph","In theory, the concept of  long tail inventory  is simple. It basically means that a small proportion of your assortment contributes a disproportionately large amount of value to your business. Of course, this means that a disproportionate amount of the assortment contributes relatively little to your business."

long-tail-inventory/,"paragraph","Good question! In principle, it would make sense to simply ignore the items in the long tail."
long-tail-inventory/,"paragraph","However, for many businesses, these are the products that set them apart from their competitors. After all, the fact that you stock a particularly long tail product that your competitors don’t, may well be one of the main reasons that customer purchases from you."
long-tail-inventory/,"paragraph","Imagine if you went to a supermarket and they had all the essentials; milk, bread and eggs. However, what would you do if they stopped stocking that one product you really want but can’t get anywhere else?"
long-tail-inventory/,"paragraph","Achieving a well-refined assortment is about far more than just simply focusing all of your attention on ensuring that the best performing lines are managed as effectively as possible. In order to maximise the profitability of the assortment, inventory decisions should not be taken lightly, especially when it concerns long tail items."
long-tail-inventory/,"paragraph","However, unless you have a complete understanding of your assortment, how can you be sure that you are making the right inventory decisions? After all, while a slow-moving line may seem like a costly waste of space in your DC, for certain customers, these items could well be the sole reason they buy from your business. Equally, if an item offers only a minimal return in terms of customer benefit or profit, is it really worth investing time and money ensuring that this item is always available?"
long-tail-inventory/,"paragraph","Managing the long tail is a delicate balancing act between service levels and keeping investment in stock under control. In order to manage these items effectively, it is important that businesses have clear visibility over how each item contributes to the overall corporate goals: through categorising items depending on their strategic importance to your business, you can begin to adopt a more tailored approach to manage the long tail."
long-tail-inventory/,"paragraph","For many businesses, it may not be clear exactly which items form part of the long tail. However, a well-structured ABC analysis can provide the insight required to identify clear product groups. While the process of conducting an ABC analysis allows you to gain a greater understanding of the assortment, it is essential that the parameters of the analysis are well aligned with the business’ overall objectives.  After all, if your business is focused on customer satisfaction, categorising items by margin alone will do little to help the business achieve its goals. How you define the boundaries within your assortment will depend heavily on what KPIs are most important to your business."
long-tail-inventory/,"paragraph","Essentially, there are two main objectives which determine the KPIs: on one hand, the focus can be on the profit margins of an item or the turnover. Alternatively, however, the financial elements can be put to one side and customer satisfaction in the form of order lines or transactions can be used as the foundation on which to build KPIs."
long-tail-inventory/,"paragraph","From service levels to stocking decisions, the insights provided by the ABC analysis should be used as a driving force to shape the assortment and help make informed decisions. The following 3 steps can be adopted today to help reduce inventory levels, improve cash flow and help maximise the profitability of your long tail."
long-tail-inventory/,"paragraph","1.       Stocking decisions"
long-tail-inventory/,"paragraph","There are likely to be a number of long tail items that are not worth stocking at all as they simply do not offer a significant enough margin to justify investing in stock. However, by not stocking such items, this may put customers off from purchasing items with much higher margins. For instance, while nuts and bolts are unlikely to offer large margins, no one will buy more expensive components if they cannot also get all the components that go with it."
long-tail-inventory/,"paragraph","Furthermore, there also may be a number of items which are currently non-stocked which would actually be better to keep stocked at all times. This is particularly true for items where there is either a longer lead time or a low level of supplier reliability."
long-tail-inventory/,"paragraph","In order to make the correct stocking decisions, businesses should base their decision on a broad range of metrics. For instance; how much margin does a product offer? Does the product have a major impact on the sales of other items? How much footfall does the item create? Is there an alternative product that could be sold instead? Does the product have a political impact on supplier relations? Is the product important to the key customers?"
long-tail-inventory/,"paragraph","Through utilising the insights from an ABC analysis to decide whether or not to change the stocking status on an item, you can boost customer satisfaction by ensuring the most important items are readily available. Equally, through using such insights to refine your assortment, you can remove items which do not contribute towards achieving the overall business goals. This, in turn, can help free up working capital which can then be reinvested elsewhere in the business."
long-tail-inventory/,"paragraph","2.       Re-assess your inventory policy"
long-tail-inventory/,"paragraph","Given that many business’ long tail items are likely to have volatile demand patterns, it can be very difficult to determine exactly how much inventory should be held. Given that the level of safety stock will differ depending on the importance of each item, it is inevitable that A-line items are likely to have a greater requirement for safety stock as going out of stock could cost the business dearly. However, for long tail items determining safety stock can be a little more challenging."
long-tail-inventory/,"paragraph","On one hand, holding excessive safety stocks could mean unnecessarily tying up working capital into slow moving stock which is always at risk of becoming obsolete. However, on the other hand insufficient inventory levels could hamper sales and leave customers disappointed. In order to ensure that inventory levels are appropriate, there are a range of factors that have to be taken into consideration."
long-tail-inventory/,"paragraph","3.        Prioritise areas which require attention"
long-tail-inventory/,"paragraph","The real advantage of a well-developed ABC analysis, is that the outcomes enable you to prioritise the areas which require the most attention. With clear insight into which items have the biggest impact on your ability to achieve your strategic goals, you can begin to focus actions on areas which will deliver the greatest benefit. For instance, in order to optimise long tail items, this may present an opportunity to re-negotiate minimum order quantities and lead times or even find entirely new suppliers."
long-tail-inventory/,"paragraph","Through reviewing each category that arises as a result of the ABC analysis, you can gain a much clearer picture of how your assortment is performing. Consequently, this approach enables you to spend more time investigating potential problem areas within the long tail, thus helping to ensure the assortment is as refined as possible."
long-tail-inventory/,"paragraph","For any business, developing a large assortment with great breadth and depth can create a huge amount of value by enabling them to satisfy the needs of their customers. However, unless managed effectively, the long tail can be a huge drain on resources. In order to offer customers the choice and availability they demand while still keeping investment in stock under control, businesses must take steps to ensure that their inventory policy is well aligned with customer expectations, stocking decisions are well informed and opportunities to improve the performance of the assortment are prioritised in order to be exploited fully."

digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","Most businesses are starting or continuing to invest in digital supply chain tools. A recent Gartner survey found  66% of companies have done so in the last 18 months . That constitutes a 26% increase compared to 2021."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","It seems the world of commerce is waking up to the prospect of possibility in digital supply chain investment and moving away from the once all-powerful spreadsheet."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","But spending money doesn’t automatically make it a wise decision. And whilst many deliberate over their tech investments, spending hard-earned company cash with even the best intentions can leave some feeling underwhelmed."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","The challenge is to make investments that pay off. Both initially and consistently – something which isn’t happening for many. In fact,  only 17% of survey respondents here  say their company’s investments in digital  supply chain  technology have lived up to their expectations."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","That’s almost one in five. This shows that for whatever reason, expenditure often doesn’t make the grade. And yet, with the correct analysis behind the decision of where to spend, there are far more upsides than there are pitfalls."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","Research from PwC backs this up . It shows that digital supply chain investment is very much worth it. Those businesses that invest in digital supply chain technology typically enjoy lower costs, increased revenue, improved  sustainability , better utilisation of assets, diminished risks, and enhanced  customer experience ."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","So where’s the money best spent?"

digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","$6 trillion is an almost unfathomable number, but with such a figure on the horizon, you might ask what’s driving such impressive growth? Let’s take a look:"
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","Most people these days click ‘buy’ on a website and look out the window for the delivery driver. In fact, research suggests 96% percent of today’s consumers consider “fast delivery” to mean “same-day” delivery."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","Obviously, those two terms aren’t synonymous."

digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","Your digital  supply chain initiatives  need a strong foundation if you want them to survive and thrive."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","They need buy-in from every stakeholder in your business, and a strong business case with investment from the top."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","This section will run through how to secure all of the above:"
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","What do your stakeholders want? And how does this compare to the wider business objectives?"
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","Your first job is to find out."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","And when we consider stakeholders, that means anyone who’ll be directly or indirectly impacted by digital change. So, budget owners, department heads, new starters, and even temporary workers."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","Does the solution you’re suggesting have the capacity to address both considerations?"
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","You should consider the opinions, goals and targets of every department, not just the supply chain. And think about IT more than you normally do, given the department’s likely involvement in rolling out any technological changes."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","Their perspective may well be crucial."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","And if you haven’t already invited someone from IT to be on the buying team, do so now as their ongoing involvement may be a shrewd acquisition. Most importantly, make sure the new system works with your existing tech stack."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","At some point, you’ll almost certainly be presenting this new technology to those within the chain. Knowing how it works, why it’s a worthwhile investment and how it fits in with your current tech will pay off handsomely."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","Good things to document might be how it shares data, the way it conforms to security standards and how it lowers company risk."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","“This process might cost us a lot of money, but it should save us a lot too.”"
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","You need to be ready for questions over the legitimacy of this process from those in the company. You already know it’s going to be tough to train staff on new systems and that you’ll definitely need them to be trained."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","But people hate change, so be ready to justify this digitalisation. You’ll put a far more powerful argument forward when the questions arise if you’re able to demonstrate the business impact, together with projected outcomes in value. This way, you’ll be far less susceptible to people questioning your authority or that of the adaptation."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","Ask your teams what matters most to them."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","Chances are, the tool you’re implementing will help them achieve their goals too. But you’ll only know that if you know what those goals are."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","Articulating the value of the proposed investment from their viewpoint and that of the company will give you a head start towards its successful implementation."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","“What’s this going to cost?” might be the first question asked. But you must look beyond the initial investment of the tech. It might even be that training staff in new methods costs more in lost time than the initial cost of the software but think of future benefits. To accurately balance the costs, value and risks, you’ll need as much information as you can find."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","You need to research data and evidence that shows the overall value of the solution. What value could it bring in improved sales? What about hitting sustainability initiatives, or employee happiness and staff retention?"
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","You must address the total cost of ownership (TCO)."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","This includes “downstream” implications, support requirements, management, maintenance and end-user training costs."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","You must also address the risks – not only the risks of investing and not investing but also the risks of less than satisfactory adoption, adopting too late, or adopting a less able tool."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","As proven above, the risk of missing out on this project is likely to be far greater than the cost of adoption."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","This is the final step and arguably the easiest of the lot."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","Once you’ve got all the information you need, relaying it should be easy providing you’ve documented it carefully."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","Turn your analysis into a business case that starts with a problem. Ideally, your company’s problem overlaps with those of multiple members of your team."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","It’s your job to explain why the problem must be addressed, and how this new solution can do that perfectly."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","If you present the technology as being critical to your company’s success, whilst simultaneously solving one of the major problems multiple people have, you’ll be well on your way to navigating its initial adoption."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","Make sure you’re able to show all activities you can optimise with the technology, including how the solution will improve the company’s KPIs and business outcomes."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","When delivering the story, tell it through the eyes of the people to whom you’re presenting. Use their language and you’ll engage them more readily. C-suite executives like language that’s concise together with high-level solutions. You’re unlikely to wow warehouse staff with the same presentation."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","Talk to the specific audience when you’re presenting, and you’ll be far more effective in your delivery."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","The results are in."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","Digital supply chain investment is the right way to go for future-proofing your business in the supply chain."
digital-supply-chain-investment/,"paragraph","But like every investment, you need careful consideration over what, where and how you spend that money.

monthly-vs-weekly-forecasting/,"paragraph","The goal of Slim4 – Slimstock’s inventory optimization software – is to predict the future. Specifically, how much of an item you’ll need to meet customer demand. Predicting the future is hard work even using historical data. With our ever more interconnected world, the number of data points available is almost limitless, so the challenge is getting the right data and using it in a way that increases predictive accuracy."
monthly-vs-weekly-forecasting/,"paragraph","When preparing to order inventory, two approaches are typically used – monthly forecasting and weekly forecasting. But which method works best? The temptation to default to weekly forecasting can be understandable because on the surface it can seem timelier and thus more accurate. If 12 data points are good, then 52 should be better, right? This isn’t always the case."
monthly-vs-weekly-forecasting/,"paragraph","In 25 years of helping customers get the right product in the right place at the right time, we’ve seen that most products can be predicted and ordered more accurately using monthly forecasting."
monthly-vs-weekly-forecasting/,"paragraph","In plain English, monthly forecasting means that sales data is captured daily and bucketed into months to produce a forecast. Similarly, weekly forecasting involves bucketing daily sales into weeks to create a forecast.  This creates 40 more forecast periods in a given year."
monthly-vs-weekly-forecasting/,"paragraph","Monthly forecasts work best for most products because they tend to generate lower forecast errors. While there is variation in how many units are sold week to week within a monthly forecast, if we’re doing our job correctly, you’ll still have the right amount on your shelves whether it’s 1 st , the 15 th  or the 30 th ."

the-pareto-principle/,"paragraph","Last updated: October 22, 2024"
the-pareto-principle/,"paragraph","Table of contents"
the-pareto-principle/,"paragraph","The Pareto Principle has really stood up to the sands of time. When this clever theory was first condoured up, who would have thought we would still use it over hundred year later?"
the-pareto-principle/,"paragraph","How much do you really know about your assortment? Do you know which items offer the greatest return or which are most important to your customers? Equally, do you know which items are costing you money? This article highlights 5 ways Pareto can help you to help boost the profitability of your assortment, minimise risk and help you manage your inventory more effectively."
the-pareto-principle/,"paragraph","It’s no secret that for many businesses,  80% of turnover is generated by just 20%  of the assortment. Given that such a large proportion of the assortment seemingly offers such little value to the business, you would be forgiven for focusing all of your attention on the best performing lines. Inventory decisions should not be taken lightly and businesses should strive to manage their entire assortment as effectively as possible."
the-pareto-principle/,"paragraph","How can you be sure that you are making the right inventory decision? After all, while a slow moving line may seem like a costly waste of space in your DC, for certain customers, these items could well be the main reason they buy from your business. Equally, if an item offers only a minimal return in terms of customer benefit or profit, is it worth investing time and money ensuring this item is always available?"
the-pareto-principle/,"paragraph","A well-structured Pareto analysis can indicate the performance of the assortment and highlight areas which require more attention. From service levels to stocking decision, the insights provided by the Pareto in the form of a ABC stock analysis should be used as a driving force to shape your assortment and optimise the performance of all your items."
the-pareto-principle/,"paragraph","How you define the boundaries within your assortment will depend heavily on what KPIs are most important to your business. Essentially, there are two main objectives which determine the KPIs: on one hand the focus can be on the profit margins of an item or the turnover. Alternatively however, the financial elements can be put to one side and customer satisfaction in the form of order lines or transactions can be used as the foundation on which to build KPIs. However, in addition to this, the following questions must also be raised when determining which category each item falls into:"
the-pareto-principle/,"paragraph","In the context of assortment management, a service level is the target % of all ordered pieces of an item that can be delivered from stock at the first requested delivery date. Given that A-line items are those which are most important to the business, whereas C-line items are likely to be slowing moving items which offer a much lower return, there is little point in setting the same service level targets."
the-pareto-principle/,"paragraph","For A-line items, the service level target should be the highest of the three categories. On the other hand, considering that B and C class items are likely to have a lower overall impact on your business’ strategic goals, setting an excessively high service level target could result in unnecessarily costs yet deliver only a small return. As a consequence, it is essential that service levels are considered carefully in order to ensure that they are both realistic and relevant to the goals of the business."
the-pareto-principle/,"paragraph","Once you have defined the desired service level for each classification, you can continue to re-assess you inventory policy. Given that the level of insurance inventory will differ depending on the importance of each item, it is enviable that A-line items are likely to have a greater requirement for safety stock as going out of stock could cost the business dearly."
the-pareto-principle/,"paragraph","However, this is not simply a case of investing heavily in safety stock for your best performing lines while ignoring C-line items. While insights from a well-structured ABC analysis can be used to guide a differentiated approach to service levels, there are still a number of factors that have to be taken into account. For instance, could certain items have a political impact on the business which require special attention? Or are there already contractual or customer obligations in place?"
the-pareto-principle/,"paragraph","Through using the Pareto Principle to assess the inventory requirements of each category, your business can optimise stock levels in order to ensure that, where required, demand is covered with safety stock while cutting excess stock across the rest of the assortment."
the-pareto-principle/,"paragraph","In addition to optimising inventory levels, the insights from conducting an ABC analysis may identify further opportunities to refine the assortment. For instance, some C line items may actually not be worth stocking at all as they simply do not offer a significant enough margin to justify holding on stock. Alternatively, there may be a number of items which are currently non-stocked which would actually be better to keep stocked at all time. This is particularly true for items where there is either a lengthy lead time or low level of supplier reliability."
the-pareto-principle/,"paragraph","Through utilising the insights from an ABC analysis to decide whether or not to change the stocking status on an item, you can boost customer satisfaction by ensuring the most important items are readily available. Equally, through using the Pareto Principle to refine your assortment, you can remove items which do not contribute towards achieving the overall business goals. This in turn can help free up working capital which can then be reinvested elsewhere in the business."
the-pareto-principle/,"paragraph","With clear insight into which items have the biggest impact on your ability to achieve your strategic goals, you can prioritise areas which require the most attention. Whether this mean taking time to re-negotiate lead time or order quantity with suppliers or develop more effective means of managing such items, the outcomes of the ABC analysis will aid you when structurally improving the way you manage your inventory."
the-pareto-principle/,"paragraph","When you consider that your A-line items are likely to be the best performing lines, negotiating more favourable lead times, or even better prices, could have a major impact. Likewise, for items which you identify as slow movers, the opportunity may arise to negotiate a smaller order quantity which in turn will result in you holding less stock."
the-pareto-principle/,"paragraph","While on an article level, these relatively minor developments may only seem to have a small impact, across the entire assortment, these can soon add up. In turn, such action can help improve overall availability, reduce inventory cost and generally improve efficiency across the board. Through utilising the ABC analysis, you can clearly see exactly where you need to prioritise time and resources in order to deliver the most value to the business."
the-pareto-principle/,"paragraph","Given that the previous 4 steps could have large potential impact on the performance of your business, it is important to monitor the effectiveness of inventory decisions in order to ensure you are moving in the right direction."
the-pareto-principle/,"paragraph","While overall stock value or overall availability could be used to compare year on year performance, unless you dig a little deeper, you will not be able to identify exactly which aspects of your assortment are performing well and which require more attention. Given that the service levels for each category are likely to be driven by very specific objectives, categorising items according to ABC classifications is a powerful way to monitor the evolution of your assortment."
the-pareto-principle/,"paragraph","Through reviewing each category that arises as a result of the ABC analysis, you can gain a much clearer picture of how your assortment is performing. Consequently, this provides you with time to investigate potential problem areas and respond accordingly. Furthermore, these categories provide a solid basis on which to report such developments to other areas of the business."

meio-supply-chain/,"paragraph","Last updated: April 17, 2023"
meio-supply-chain/,"paragraph","Table of contents"
meio-supply-chain/,"paragraph","For companies that exist in today’s complex omnichannel and multisite environment, achieving stock availability has never been more difficult … and costly! With more channels, more demanding customers and an increasing number of products to manage, many organisations can quickly lose sight of their inventory position. Faced with expensive excess stock levels and crippling shortages, what can businesses do to enhance visibility across their integrated supply chain? entire operation?"
meio-supply-chain/,"paragraph","Businesses today exist in far more complicated environments than ever before. Given that a typical supply chain is now comprised of an increasing number of levels and channels, it is vital that inventory is managed effectively across the entire network. However, with so many different links in the network (DC, regional DCs, branches etc), ensuring that stock is available in the right time at the right place has never been more difficult."
meio-supply-chain/,"paragraph","Excess stock is one of the biggest challenges that businesses face when planning across multiple locations. The problem can be exacerbated by the bullwhip effect; a notorious phenomenon, where safety stock is built up at each location and where a relatively small change in demand leads to a disproportionate increase in stock at the beginning of the chain. Furthermore, ensuring that the right stock is available at the right locations is another major issue that must be managed carefully. Failure to do so could result in; revenue loss, disappointed customers and unnecessary inventory costs."
meio-supply-chain/,"paragraph","It is important that your business adopts the most suitable planning approach. However, which approach is best for your business?"
meio-supply-chain/,"paragraph","Nowadays supply chains have transformed from connected serial networks to multi-channel networks (see figure). In a serial network, a location will only ship products to the proceeding level of the chain. On the other hand, where there is a more dynamic flow of goods where by products are distributed from a single location to multiple levels, this is known as a multi-channel environment. As the number of channels increases, the complexity within the chain grows exponentially."
meio-supply-chain/,"paragraph","In order to optimise inventory across an entire multi-channel environment, visibility is king! In an ideal world, all the required supply chain information would always be visible for everyone in the chain. In order to ensure a smooth flow of goods a lot of information (purchase orders, demands, stock levels, lead times, etc.) has to be exchanged between the different locations. The extent to which this information is accessible is what we call ‘visibility’. The level of visibility throughout the network determines how advanced the forecast and optimal order size calculations can be."
meio-supply-chain/,"paragraph","Through exploring different network structures and levels of visibility, we define three basic scenarios for inventory planning:"
meio-supply-chain/,"paragraph","<img decoding=""async"" class=""wp-image-90148 alignleft"" src=""https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/picture2.png.webp"" alt=""Picture2"" width=""220"" height=""185"" srcset=""https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/picture2.png.webp 435w,https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/picture2-300x252.png.webp 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px"">"
meio-supply-chain/,"paragraph","For the first scenario, we assume a traditional serial network exists. Only for the central level information about lead times and stock level is available and inventory planning is calculated on the basis of the historical demand on the central warehouse location."
meio-supply-chain/,"paragraph","So when making a forecast, only the independent demand data from this (central) warehouse is taken into account. No information from the other locations and echelons is used which can leave a business exposed to the bull whip effect."
meio-supply-chain/,"paragraph","In the second scenario we assume that information about the replenishment requirements and the lead times of the proceeding channels is also available. Decisions are made on the basis of historical demand AND the replenishment requirements from underlying channels."
meio-supply-chain/,"paragraph","<img decoding=""async"" class=""alignright wp-image-90167"" src=""https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/picture3.png.webp"" alt=""Picture3"" width=""220"" height=""185"" srcset=""https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/picture3.png.webp 435w,https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/picture3-300x252.png.webp 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px""> Communication plays a key role in this configuration; the exchanging of information within the network can reduce the bullwhip effect dramatically. In contrast to the first scenario,"
meio-supply-chain/,"paragraph","the forecast can be improved by taking into account the replenishment needs of the underlying locations and channels."
meio-supply-chain/,"paragraph","This way of planning is also known as Distribution Requirements Planning (DRP). For the calculation of the forecast, it is important that the information from the lower levels is up-to-date and reliable. This scenario can give better results than the first scenario, but that depends on the situation. It’s definitely more complex and still lacks insight in the real customer demand."
meio-supply-chain/,"paragraph","<img decoding=""async"" class=""alignleft wp-image-90187"" src=""https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/picture4.png.webp"" alt=""Picture4"" width=""220"" height=""187"" srcset=""https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/picture4.png.webp 435w,https://www.slimstock.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/picture4-300x255.png.webp 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px""> In this third scenario we assume full visibility across all echelons of the network, including demand on consumer level. In this scenario inventory planning is driven by Point of Sales (POS) data. With this data, an optimal inventory and replenishment plan can be calculated for both the central and local branches. The uncertainty which leads to excess stock is minimized."

meio-supply-chain/,"paragraph","Companies should think carefully before they decide which scenario to adopt. The most advanced scenario doesn’t necessarily give the best results.

supplier-collaboration/,"paragraph","Supplier collaboration can unlock huge performance improvements. Many businesses invest a huge amount of time and effort into developing robust internal processes that secure availability and keep costs under control. Although the importance of business rules and internal flows can never be overlooked, business leaders must keep one crucial face in mind: a business is only as strong as its weakest supplier!"
supplier-collaboration/,"paragraph","To achieve true operational excellence, businesses must look beyond their own operation and strive to build more profitable relationships with suppliers. After all, the performance of your business is hugely dependent on your supplier delivering as agreed."
supplier-collaboration/,"paragraph","Consider the following observations:"
supplier-collaboration/,"paragraph","• You order more inventory than necessary because the supplier has a minimum order quantity"
supplier-collaboration/,"paragraph","• You order additional stock to offset the uncertainty in demand during the long delivery time"
supplier-collaboration/,"paragraph","• You hold additional safety stock to accommodate for any deviations in the supplier delivery agreement"
supplier-collaboration/,"paragraph","In all of these scenarios, your business has to make huge investments in stock in order to compensate for poor supplier performance. But is this really the best approach? To help you adopt more effective and collaborative supplier relationships, we have outlined 4 key focus areas to help you improve supplier collaboration."
supplier-collaboration/,"paragraph","Renegotiating contracts and changing product requirements often depends on both your relationship with the supplier and how dependent the supplier is on you. If for example, an item that you identified through your ABC analysis was an A item for you but only a C item for your supplier, this obviously leaves you in a weak negotiating position. It is also important to know if your suppliers are manufacturing goods just for you or if they supply you from stock."
supplier-collaboration/,"paragraph","An important tool to consider when assessing suppliers is their delivery performance. The most common KPI’s to measure here is the On Time In Full rate (OTIF): what percentage of complete cases are delivered on time?"
supplier-collaboration/,"paragraph","Additionally, the deviation in actual delivery time is also important to consider: did the order arrive on the agreed delivery date as expected? After all, there is a big difference if the supplier delivers a day earlier or later compared with if the arrival is delayed by several weeks."
supplier-collaboration/,"paragraph","Just by measuring the delivery performance of your suppliers, you should see a natural improvement. However, if not, it is time for a stern conversation."
supplier-collaboration/,"paragraph","In the previous project, we highlighted how you can determine the optimal order quantities. However, in reality, it is not possible to realise these levels if suppliers have in place “strict” minimum order quantities (MOQs). But who actually determines these MOQs? In many cases, a simple call to the supplier will reveal that these are rarely set in stone and may not even be relevant any more. There is always room for negotiation!"
supplier-collaboration/,"paragraph","Your suppliers can often provide a faster and more reliable service if they know what orders to expect from you. By sharing forecasts, the supplier can better anticipate future demand. There are many advanced technologies for harnessing collaboration. However, simply forwarding an email of the demand forecast can also yield great results!"

grocery-inventory-management/,"paragraph","From food redistribution schemes to  intelligent fridge cameras  that help prevent consumers from over-buying, retailers have embraced waste reduction as an opportunity to innovate. However, while such steps have contributed to delivering an overall waste reduction, few retailers have been brave enough to tackle one of the biggest sources of avoidable waste: ineffective grocery inventory management processes."
grocery-inventory-management/,"paragraph","Take for instance the recent reports of retailers removing  ‘best before’ dates  from certain fruit and vegetable products in a bid to prevent consumers confusing them with ‘sell by’ dates. This probably will help retailers reduce waste. After all, from the perspective of the consumer, by removing the best before date, retailers are seemingly prolonging the shelf life of the product. But are expiration dates the full extent of the problem? The answer is: most certainly not!"
grocery-inventory-management/,"paragraph","Retailers must do more than merely treat the symptoms. If a product is a frequent cause of waste, questions have to be asked as to why: is it because the replenishment process is inefficient? Is the product allocated correctly? Was too much inventory ordered in the first place? Ultimately, to achieve real waste reductions, retailers must tackle the problem at its source."
grocery-inventory-management/,"paragraph","The food industry should be applauded for the progress made in just two years. However, in order to achieve the waste reduction goals retailers have set themselves, the food industry must adopt a fresh approach to the way they manage fresh products within their supply chain."
grocery-inventory-management/,"paragraph","In order to prevent waste, industry leaders must be proactive and take appropriate action to improve inefficient processes. For many retailers, this will mean they not only need to focus on waste but also on maximising product freshness throughout the chain. However, by putting in place more effective grocery inventory management processes retailers will not only attack the true causes of avoidable waste but also create greater value for customers."
grocery-inventory-management/,"paragraph","Given that the issue of waste is a top priority for the industry, what is your business doing to prevent food waste in your business?"

demand-management/,"paragraph","Demand management is all about keeping customers happy. However, while no business wants to let its customers down, there are always financial constraints in place. Consequently, building huge stock piles of inventory to satisfy potential customer demand which may (or may not) materialise, is simply not an option. So how should you anticipate, validate and prepare for future demand?"
demand-management/,"paragraph","To satisfy demand, inventory is a necessary evil. However, when you consider the impact of demand volatility, fluctuating supply chain costs and the need to maintain a healthy level of working capital, determining exactly how much capital should be invested in inventory is a difficult question. Effective demand management is all about balancing this risk in order to maximise customer satisfaction while minimised inventory cost."
demand-management/,"paragraph","Customers rarely buy exactly what you think they will purchase. If you expect a customer to place a huge order and the demand never materialises, invaluable working capital could become locked up in excess stock. Likewise, if you decide not to invest inventory and the customer does actually commit to the order, fulfilling the demand in time could be a real challenge."
demand-management/,"paragraph","In reality, you cannot please everyone- at least not without leaving your businesses bankrupt. Consequently, to remain responsive to demand supply chain teams must have a robust process in place to anticipate, validate and then fulfil future demand."
demand-management/,"paragraph","Ultimately, when it comes to demand management, 5 key questions should drive all decision making:"
demand-management/,"paragraph","1) What products do your customers want?"
demand-management/,"paragraph","2) How many units do they want?"
demand-management/,"paragraph","3) How soon do they want to receive the order?"
demand-management/,"paragraph","4) How likely are they to commit to the order?"
demand-management/,"paragraph","5) How much are you willing to risk?"
demand-management/,"paragraph","The starting point for any demand management process is the forecast. Using several years of demand history and the most appropriate forecasting method, effective demand forecasting tools can help businesses to identify trends in the data and thus gain an idea of what future demand might look like."
demand-management/,"paragraph","The question is, to what extent can you rely on this insight?"
demand-management/,"paragraph","Historic demand can only tell you so much about the future. After all, from the impact of new customers to the influence of weather on sales, there is an infinite number of factors that can influence demand!"
demand-management/,"paragraph","Demand management is about more than just using historic sales to build a forecast. Demand management is about taking a robust forecast and enriching the data to make informed supply chain decisions!"

sales-and-operations-planning-process/,"paragraph","One of the key challenges that many companies face is in maintaining good communication throughout the organisation and ensuring all teams focus on the same priorities. With no effective means of communicating, organisational silos can develop, and departmental priorities could compromise any coordinated action required to satisfy customer requirements efficiently. Ultimately, working in this dysfunctional way will eventually lead to poor customer service and lost sales."
sales-and-operations-planning-process/,"paragraph","This is where sales and operations planning comes in!"
sales-and-operations-planning-process/,"paragraph","Sales and operations planning is effective when it involves people working a coordinated process, enabled at various stages by technology to meet company goals rather than personal ones. Through establishing an effective process, your business will ultimately benefit from the formalisation of a more structured supply and demand planning process which is underpinned by rules based on organisational accountability and the financial performance goals in place."

In addition, performance indicator reports will help validate the effectiveness of each team’s planning cycle and ensure continuous quality is a key expectation of your process. As the complete solution for inventory optimisation, Slim4 can be utilised to provide the vision, insight and control required to enhance your inventory processes."
sales-and-operations-planning-process/,"paragraph","As part of the supply chain planning process, key stakeholders from various disciplines within the company reach a consensus about the corporate strategy. The output of the process is a realignment of tactical plans throughout all departments ensuring that all activity supports of the company’s business plan."
sales-and-operations-planning-process/,"paragraph","The S&OP planning process is an instrument for dealing with changing business conditions by enabling management to decide what the entire company should prioritise each month."

However, when it comes to planning, our inventory solution provides a “one true vision” of aniticipated demand. However, Slim4 can also be utilised to re-plan inventory based on new priorities, formulate scenarios around product life cycles, align safety stock strategies to your customer’s expectations, and clarify the potential impact inventory decisions. Slim4’s functionality can support our customer’s sales and operations planning process in the following ways:"
sales-and-operations-planning-process/,"paragraph","The first step in an effective sales and operations planning process is in determining which products should be stocked and which should be ordered as and when required. Slim4 provides relevant insight to ensure successful decision making around product introductions as well as for products approaching the end of the product lifecycle. By providing such insight, can help you make decisions on which items should be stocked and which items should be better off as non-stocked. Ultimately, Slim4 ensures the correct decisions are made to support business goals and streamline cash flow."
sales-and-operations-planning-process/,"paragraph","Given that all inventory decisions are based upon forecasts, supply chain teams must be confident that the numbers are a reliable reflection of anticipated demand. Using sophisticated exception criteria, Slim4 identifies irregular demand characteristics that could impact your forecast. Using this data, the solution automatically calculates accurate forecasts based on advanced statistics taking into to account seasonality and evolving trends. Through providing more scientific forecasts, you can be confident all decisions made during the S&OP process are based on quality forecast data that you can trust!"

Whether you’re launching a new product or promoting seasonal items to increase sales, the promotional planning capability within in Slim4 is designed to close the gap between your upside potential and current baseline forecast. As a result, your business becomes better positioned to anticipate promotional demand, determine the optimal order volumes and align delivery schedules; all while maximising the sales opportunity and minimising the risk of excess at the end of the promotion."
sales-and-operations-planning-process/,"paragraph","One of the main purposed of sales and operations planning is to identify and resolve inventory issues to achieve the optimal inventory situation. Slim4’s order planning functionality automatically determines time-phased inventory requirements that are economically adjusted.

is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","“As levers of financial management go, none bears more weight than working capital. The viability of every business activity rests on daily changes in receivables, inventory, and payables.” -S.L. Mintz."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","Whether selling a revolutionary product or essential service, the challenges of gaining access to the working capital necessary for production capacity expansion, marketing initiatives, or fluctuating inventory needs affect nearly all businesses."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","More than two-thirds of business owners said they faced challenges growing their businesses over the past year. More than 12% did not understand how to obtain the working capital necessary to facilitate expansion.1 With increasing frequency, business owners are turning to external funding sources to secure money to fuel growth instead of exploiting the potential capital they have tied up in inventory."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","The importance of cash flow in a healthy business cannot be overstated. More cash on hand provides the following benefits:"
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","Businesses rarely go bankrupt because of a lack of earnings, but a lack of cash on hand can be the kiss of death."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","Most business owners remain unaware of the crucial truth that they already have access to the capital they require. It doesn’t involve cold-calling relatives or meeting a single loan officer. Instead, for most businesses, simply optimizing inventory control, cash flow, and operational processes can give them access to ample capital to expand without having to make compromises or sacrifices on initiatives that will yield positive ROI."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","So how can businesses access this untapped reserve of cash to fuel growth, boost profits, and increase viability? It starts with examining the financial supply chain."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","The problem with any organization is that it has an increasing requirement to raise more working capital as it grows. Often, that working capital will come either from shareholders or out of the company’s asset base. Yet, ironically, most companies constrain their ability to grow by limiting their working capital in two primary areas."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","The first area is Accounts Receivable, where companies struggle to reconcile how fast they pay with how fast they collect. The delta between Days Sales Outstanding and Days Payables Outstanding usually contains working capital that can be relieved without shareholders digging into their pockets for more equity."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","The second area that holds the highest amount of promise in the area of inventory. If your company makes, manufactures, or distributes goods, the chances of having inventory on your shelves longer than required or turning over more slowly than required than you need are staggeringly high. Thus, the single biggest opportunity to improve working capital is in the area of inventory reduction."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","By fine-tuning each area, organizations can significantly boost their cash flow, giving them access to previously untapped resources that can be funnelled back into the business. Sounds easy? With the right tools, processes, and people in place, it can be."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","When generating more working capital, SMEs continue to take the ‘easy route and amass mind-boggling amounts of debt rather than improve their internal processes. A 2015 working capital survey from CFO Magazine found that companies continue to take on “alarming amounts” of debt. Corporate debt rose by over 9% in 2014 to nearly $4.6 trillion, with companies leveraging low-interest rates to fund increased investment activities."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","According to the same survey, “companies once again made almost no improvement in working capital management, doing little to generate cash internally by optimizing how they collect from customers, pay suppliers, and manage inventory,” a finding that echoed survey results from previous years.3 Companies that saw their debt double since 2007 had their working capital performance worsen dramatically, while companies that decreased their debt over the same period saw significant improvement."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","Most eye-opening was the finding that companies in the study could improve cash flow to the tune of  $1 trillion  simply by matching the performance of top companies in their industry, with inventory optimization representing the lion’s share of the opportunity."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","$1 trillion is a lot of cash to leave on the table while seeking out record-setting levels of debt. So why are SMEs continuing to ignore the clear benefit of inventory optimization?"
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","First, let’s look at the culprits responsible for eroding your cash flow."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","As a high-velocity cash-generating machine, the last thing you want is inventory sitting around a warehouse collecting dust. Therefore, a large part of inventory optimization is increasing inventory turn and converting products into cash sooner. So why is your inventory turn failing?"
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","You may be:"
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","These issues can result in a dramatic decrease in sales and occupy valuable real estate, preventing you from acquiring more viable products."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","So how can SMEs address these issues?"
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","1) Inventory visibility: Market-leading businesses not only track stock on hand meticulously, but they also have comprehensive visibility into the entire supply chain, with advanced knowledge of when goods will arrive."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","2) Forecasting: The ability to make proactive purchasing decisions is essential for companies to remain competitive, and it doesn’t require a fortune teller or psychic. Modern inventory optimization applies several advanced forecasting methodologies to forecast demand for countless items automatically."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","3) Timing: When it comes to proactive purchasing, however, there is such a thing as too proactive. Filling warehouses with out-of-season stock that will lie dormant for months can decimate your bottom line. The significance of not ordering the right product at the right time cannot be overstated. Due to the innate complexities of inventory management and order, whenever possible, it’s recommended companies automate this process via software so that automated daily order recommendations are provided when the stock dips below a certain threshold or when your forecasting identifies spikes in demand."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","4) Shorten your order to delivering period: Reducing lead time and optimizing logistics should be priority number one for companies looking to shorten Days of Working Capital."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","Three distinct touch-points can be addressed:"
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","5) Shorten time to market new products: From the moment resources are committed to a new product, you’re burning cash until you can capitalize on sales; therefore, businesses must make every effort to shorten the time it takes to get new products market. Implementing or improving project management, improving oversight of manufacturing changes, and improving design team collaboration can help quicker put cash in your hands."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","Just how drastic an impact can small shifts in inventory optimization have on working capital?"
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","In this example, we’re looking at a company with:"
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","Let’s look at two ways this situation can be handled."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","Company B hasn’t invested in inventory management. Their sales agents are exaggerating forecasts to ensure there are products to sell. Production increases their production rates to meet the additional (nonexistent) sales demand. Their service department is too busy with customers to enter billable time, so invoices are created two weeks late. Concerned about causing downtime, Purchasing buys additional inventory, burying the old stock in the back of a warehouse. Receiving becomes overwhelmed and has difficulty reconciling supplier invoices to receipts, yet pays them anyway. Shipping subcontracts outside carriers based on the expectation that they’ll meet the increased sales demand. And on, and on and on."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","‘Company A’ shortens the sales cycle by ten days, extends their days to settle AP by ten days (to 40 days total, well within the realm of acceptability), and drops Days of Sales inventory from 110 days to 100 days by implementing software that gives them increased inventory optimization capabilities. By making these three small changes, they’ve managed to free up $1,730,386 in working capital and decrease the runway to convert cash to revenue from 190 to 180 days."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","With an inventory optimization tool in play, improved forecasting and demand, increased stock turnover, and sustained sales due to improved inventory management, Company A decides they can cut another ten days from DSI, shortening it from 100 days to 90 (from the original 110).  By simply cutting 20 additional days from DSI, working capital improves to over $2.275m, and DWC has shortened 20 days annually, from 190 to 170.  Remember that $1 trillion statistics cited earlier? When you scale this equation across the multitude of SMEs in the US, it’s easy to see how it can be achieved."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","When it comes to new systems versus new equipment, business owners frequently evaluate based on perceived ROI. The problem is that projects with solid ROI potential require capital investment, and cash flow is limited for most businesses. And while the initial reaction is to choose the project that will yield the fastest, it’s imperative to consider what will yield the best. In addition, examining how each project will impact your business over the next 5-10 years will lead to a more sound business decision."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","Cash flow doesn’t replace traditional ROI — it accelerates it. By implementing solutions and systems that generate additional cash flow, organizations can invest in multiple projects in tandem, boosting the company’s profitability without making compromises."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","For example, two projects are presented: a new system and new equipment, each requiring a capital expenditure of $200k. The equipment has an expected ROI of 2 years, while the system has an expected ROI of 4. However, the system is also expected to generate $500k in additional cash flow annually."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","Using the table below, it’s easy to deduce that the capital-freeing expenditure is the wisest investment out of the gate, freeing enough capital to invest in the necessary equipment in year 2, and both projects returning positive yields in the years following."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","Businesses can dramatically improve their operations by rethinking how they invest in their business and avoiding the common trap of opting for the fastest ROI. Instead, by choosing to invest in a system that helps generate capital, you’re better able to fuel the growth of your entire organization, including concurrent positive ROI projects."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","When we talk about working capital, we’re speaking about the liquidity available to be used in day-to-day operations. This will be assets (receivables + inventory) for most businesses, minus liabilities (payables)."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","$1 trillion is a lot of cash to leave on the table while seeking out record-setting levels of debt. So why are SMEs continuing to ignore the clear benefit of inventory optimization?"
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","If your business has $3m in the beginning A/R, $1m in beginning inventory, and another $1m in beginning payables, your working capital is $3m."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","DSO  (or Days Sales Outstanding) refers to the amount of time, on average, it takes a company to collect revenue after the completion of a sale."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","DSO  = Average Accounts Receivable / Total Sales * 365 For a company with $10m in annual sales and an average AR balance of $2m, DSO is calculated at 73."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","DPO  (or Days Payables Outstanding) is the duration it takes for a company to settle contracts with suppliers and vendors."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","DPO  = Average Accounts Payable / Total Annual Purchases * 365 If your annual purchases total $5m, with an average A/P balance of $2m, your"
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","DPO  is 146 days."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","DSI  (or Days Sales of Inventory) is the length of time it will take a company to sell all of its inventory."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","DSI  = Average Inventory / Annual Cost of Sales * 365"
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","Inventory Turns  = Annual Cost of Sales / Average Inventory For a company with an annual cost of sales of $8m and an average inventory of $1.5m, it will take 68 days to sell all on-hand stock, necessitating five inventory turns in a calendar year."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","DWC  (or Days of Working Capital) measures how many days it will take to convert its working capital into revenue. The faster a company does this, the better."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","DWC  = Working Capital/Sales * 365 If payables exceed the sum of receivables and inventory, DWC is negative."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","If your company has $1m in A/R, $2m in on-hand inventory, $1m outstanding in A/P, $2m in working capital and $10m in annual sales, your DWC is 73."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","DWC, as well as the other metrics discussed above, will vary depending on industry and sector. For example, wireless communications have an economy-leading DWC of negative 29 days (meaning they convert working capital into revenue nearly 30 full days in advance — if you’ve ever wondered why this is, look at your cellphone bill.) The top five industries for DWC are conglomerates, transportation, industrial transportation, and food retailers and wholesalers."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","Regardless of your industry, there are simple steps you can start taking today that will shorten your DWC cycle and put more cash in hand immediately."
is-your-business-trapped-in-cash-flow-hell/,"paragraph","The numerous financial and organizational benefits of inventory optimization software can no longer be ignored by companies wanting to reclaim their piece of that $1 trillion pie. The most important thing an organization can do is carefully consider the significant way inventory optimization can transform their business. From improving cash flow to reducing deadstock, an inventory optimization solution can differentiate between increasing debt and fueling business growth."

food-inventory-management/,"paragraph","Table of contents"
food-inventory-management/,"paragraph","Food inventory management – A typical characteristic of fruit & vegetable products in the produce category is that suppliers, packaging and prices change throughout the year. Produce buyers know exactly when to switch countries but do they know how much they have to buy? How can they ensure optimum in-store availability without having to make expensive last-minute purchase orders that kill margins?"
food-inventory-management/,"paragraph","The supply chain for produce is extremely dynamic. Supply, quality and price depend on the crop yields in different countries. Furthermore, consumer demand can fluctuate hugely from one day to another. As a result, to find the right balance, produce buyers have to be real specialists in this area."
food-inventory-management/,"paragraph","They know the global fruit and vegetables market and they know exactly what is harvested when. For example, in the summer they source their cauliflowers from Dutch farmers whereas, in the winter, they look to Spanish or Italian suppliers. They also have to have a sixth sense when it comes to quality and price. Furthermore, the continuous and timely switch of suppliers is in their DNA."
food-inventory-management/,"paragraph","Buyers of fruit and vegetables know everything about quality, price and country of origin, but are often left in the dark when it comes to the expected consumer demand. Order quantities are based on orders from the past without checking whether these purchase orders were actually right in the first place."
food-inventory-management/,"paragraph","Moreover, the sales of fruit and vegetable are strongly influenced by the weather. If the weather is much better than expected, demand for iceberg lettuce and other BBQ-friendly products will rise while demand for many other fruit and vegetable products drop."
food-inventory-management/,"paragraph","A good forecast is crucial for negotiating the right contracts with suppliers and placing daily orders. However, without the right insight, the risk of overordering and thus avoidable shrinkage is greatly increased. Equally, empty shelves are also more likely as a consequence of under-ordering. Because stock-outs are totally out of the question for many food retailers, buyers often have to place all kinds of additional orders with suppliers; or worse still… the competitors. The prices at this point are obviously much higher and as a result, these last-minute actions are real margin killers!"
food-inventory-management/,"paragraph","By distinguishing between generic products (e.g. cauliflower) and varieties of the same product (e.g. Dutch cauliflower, Spanish Cauliflower etc.) we always ensure that buyers have a complete picture of sales performance.Furthermore, the specific units used by different suppliers are automatically converted to the standard unit to ensure no misunderstandings arise."
food-inventory-management/,"paragraph","Suppliers from different countries have different delivery times, delivery periods and pack quantities. In produce, the optimum order quantity is not a single number. Instead, you will have to differentiate the order quantity depending on the country of origin and supplier."
food-inventory-management/,"paragraph","By using software that calculates a reliable forecast of the daily demand, ensuring the optimal order quantity per supplier, a buyer can optimally determine which supplier is offering the best deal. The rest of the process can then be fully automated."
food-inventory-management/,"paragraph","In order to curb the extreme dynamics in supply and demand and make maximum use of the market knowledge of the produce buyers, food retailers must have in place advanced supply chain software. By giving purchase teams insight into the expected demand as well as providing optimal ordering advice, they can concentrate fully on their core responsibilities. Ultimately, by ordering the right quantities, shrinkage and “expensive” rush orders can be directly avoided."

10-different-types-of-stock-in-your-warehouse/,"paragraph","“Too much inventory value! Do something now to lower the working capital invested in the stock!” This exchange between Finance and Operations is as typical as it is challenging to execute. A request is made (or an order is given!) to free up working capital by optimizing inventory, without jeopardizing availability."
10-different-types-of-stock-in-your-warehouse/,"paragraph","But how? Reducing working capital to meet budgets requires making real-world changes to specific items to lower your inventory levels. The first step to doing so is identifying the different types of stock in your warehouse or storeroom. In this article, we’ll look at the ten different types of stock that can be recognized within working capital, and useful strategies for managing each of them."
10-different-types-of-stock-in-your-warehouse/,"paragraph","This type of stock is directly related to the different batch sizes used to process orders. The correct lot size is the one that delivers the lowest total cost, striking a balance between the cost of placing orders and the cost of maintaining inventory."
10-different-types-of-stock-in-your-warehouse/,"paragraph","For example, if you receive an order for 1,000 units of a specific product, it might seem simple enough to buy or produce precisely that many. However, if a cost analysis shows that it is more efficient to buy or make 1,500 units, then merely fulfilling the order as it is given is not an optimal use of resources. In this case, the 500 extra units are the stock type known as “lot size.” This stock exists because an order was increased to meet the lot size established by the company."
10-different-types-of-stock-in-your-warehouse/,"paragraph","If you knew exactly how much your future demand would be, then you’d never need to order extra inventory. However, things aren’t that easy in the real world. Instead, predicted future demand must be balanced against expected lead times. Safety stock is kept in your warehouse to help cover future uncertainty in either demand or lead times or both. While it does require more working capital, the ability of safety stock to help you maintain service level pays off in the long run by ensuring strong customer relationships."
10-different-types-of-stock-in-your-warehouse/,"paragraph","Imagine a company that sells umbrellas all over the world. In some of the locations – like the rainy coast of Southern Chile – it will sell units year-round. But at most sites, the highest sales will always occur during the wettest months of the year, so inventory during those months is also higher."
10-different-types-of-stock-in-your-warehouse/,"paragraph","Because sales for these items follow the seasons – whether it’s holidays, sports or climate – this is known as “seasonal stock.” Because this is usually when a majority of these items are sold, the seasonal demand patterns must be planned for. For instance, if the highest sales for umbrellas in Northern California are between June and August, orders for them may be concentrated between May and July."
10-different-types-of-stock-in-your-warehouse/,"paragraph","This type of stock is commonly found in manufacturing companies with resource-intensive operations. It is defined as the excess stock that is maintained during the period where demand is less than the productive capacity."
10-different-types-of-stock-in-your-warehouse/,"paragraph","For instance, imagine a company that manufactures glass ornaments, and whose furnaces cannot be turned off. The monthly production capacity can be 10,000, although the demand fluctuates between 15,000 in some months and 5,000 units in others. Inventory optimization occurs by maximizing the productive capacity of the oven. Stock capacity units will be sold in those months where demand is higher."
10-different-types-of-stock-in-your-warehouse/,"paragraph","It makes sense that manufacturing companies carry a stock of raw materials and finished products. However, they also commonly carry partially finished products, depending on production best practices and expected demand."
10-different-types-of-stock-in-your-warehouse/,"paragraph","These partially finished items are “work in progress stock,” and they help businesses react more quickly to customer requirements such as seasonality. Optimization is achieved when Instead, resources are used to prepare products some of the way towards completion when demand is low. Doing so allows order to be completed in days instead of weeks once they are received."
10-different-types-of-stock-in-your-warehouse/,"paragraph","Your product assortment is made up of hundreds or maybe hundreds of thousands of items; however, some are more important than others. If your company makes door hinges but sources your screws through a third party, having access to brass, nickel and steel are more important on a day-to-day basis than screws. Because they are essential to the operation of your business, these items are known as “strategic stock.”"
10-different-types-of-stock-in-your-warehouse/,"paragraph","Many raw goods – such as metals, ores, or lumber – are strategic stock in part because they are not always available. They may come from unstable parts of the world, or be highly dependent on unpredictable phenomena such as tropical storms or sea ice. Strategic stock is similar to safety stock. However, the difference is that it is determined by senior management and not statistically. For this reason, identifying strategic stock is essential for inventory optimization."

10-different-types-of-stock-in-your-warehouse/,"paragraph","In addition to the six types of the stock listed above, there are four other stock classes. These classes did not fit a strict definition of stock types, but they are usually presented as such."
10-different-types-of-stock-in-your-warehouse/,"paragraph","Although this inventory is available in theory, in practice, it is essentially useless. It corresponds to items that have no movement. Some companies decide to keep it “just in case,” while others make great efforts to clean it and financially assume obsolescence. Read our advice on how to handle obsolete inventory here – 4 Steps to Trim Down Your Excess Inventory"
10-different-types-of-stock-in-your-warehouse/,"paragraph","Machinery companies always need to have the necessary spare parts available as a cost of doing business. This means they have to keep specific items in stock indefinitely, to respond to customer warranty claims. Doing so allows your customers to keep their machinery running and builds positive customer relationships."
10-different-types-of-stock-in-your-warehouse/,"paragraph","These are items that for a variety of reasons – e.g. predictable demand, strategic importance, etc. – have minimum order levels, which they should never be below."
10-different-types-of-stock-in-your-warehouse/,"paragraph","This is an administrative class of stock that shows the units which are pending to arrive from the supplier to the warehouse. It is understood that it is a component of the financial stock and that it could be accounted for financially based on the “cost of ownership.”"
